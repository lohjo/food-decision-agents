# feat: Voice-Note Multi-Agent Wiki

> **Current status (2026-05-13):** Archived historical plan. It was replaced by `plans/sensemaking-agents.md`, which has since been superseded by the shipped VIPS Wiki Pivot, Managed Agents, and World Studio work. See `plans/CURRENT_STATE.md`.
>
> **Target repo:** standalone at `~/Developer/sensemaking-agents/voice-wiki/`. Resolved 2026-05-08 in favor of standalone (over a new monorepo or re-cloned pi-mono) because the v2 trajectory is a hosted SaaS that will live in its own server-side codebase — a v1 monorepo would only ever hold one package.

## Summary

A local-first CLI package that records voice notes, transcribes them with whisper.cpp, runs them through a Reframer (structured extraction over the transcript) and a deterministic Librarian (SQLite + FTS5), and on a daily schedule has a Sense-Maker produce a digest plus a versioned, evidence-anchored self-portrait. A separate `voice-wiki review` command surfaces retrieval-practice questions over the accumulated wiki. Built on the **Claude Agent SDK** (`@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`) with `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` for fast per-note extraction and `claude-sonnet-4-6` for the daily Sense-Maker. **Anthropic-only by design** — multi-provider portability is dropped in favor of a smaller surface and the privacy posture afforded by [Anthropic Commercial Terms §B](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/commercial-terms) (no training on Customer Content). Local-first means *storage* is local (audio, transcripts, DB, self-portrait stay on disk and are never uploaded as files); *inference* is cloud.

The CLI exposes three modes that map to the product loop: **Capture** (`listen` / `ingest`), **Understand** (`digest` / `self-portrait` / `query` / `status`), **Practice** (`review`). Plus an Ops surface (`schedule` / `config` / `doctor`).

**v1 scope** is the local-first CLI as described in this plan. **v2 trajectory** is a hosted multi-tenant SaaS with public sign-up and billing — a separate plan, not in scope here. v1 is intentionally designed to validate the agent loop and self-portrait calibration cheaply before any hosted-service investment. The four-agent core (Reframer / Librarian / Sense-Maker / Quizmaster) and the Zod schema contracts in `types.ts` are intentionally kept stateless and portable so they can later be lifted into a server runtime; the local-only pieces (ffmpeg mic capture, whisper.cpp, SQLite, launchd) are explicit v1-only choices that v2 will replace.

---

## Problem Frame

The user wants spoken thoughts captured as fast as possible, then automatically reframed, filed into a connected wiki, and periodically synthesized into insights and a "who am I right now" view. Today, this requires either a stack of disconnected tools (voice memo → manual transcription → Obsidian → manual review) or all-in-one products (Granola, Reflect, Audiopen) that hold the data and offer limited orchestration. The system here is single-user, local-first, and explicitly composes a small number of agents over an open SQLite store so the data is portable and the orchestration is auditable.

---

## Core Principles

These are the load-bearing product commitments the implementation must respect. Every schema field, agent prompt, and CLI affordance below should trace back to one of these.

1. **The raw note is sacred.** `raw_transcript` is preserved on every note row alongside `cleaned_text` and is never overwritten or deleted by the agent pipeline. Retention sweeps the audio file, not the transcript.
2. **Understanding beats summarization.** A shorter note is not a better note. The Reframer's job is structured extraction (chunks, entities, relationships, interpretation), not compression. The original transcript and the structured representation are both first-class.
3. **Confusion is valuable.** The Sense-Maker explicitly surfaces what the user has *not* yet thought through (`tutor_prompts` and `open_questions`), not just what they've concluded. Polished output that hides confusion is a regression.
4. **The user remains the thinker.** Agents extract, connect, question, and prompt — they do not draw conclusions on the user's behalf. Self-portrait claims must cite evidence; uncited claims are rewritten as "Insufficient evidence yet for X."
5. **Every generated claim has provenance.** Each chunk and entity carries a `grounding` label: `from_notes` (directly supported by the transcript), `inferred` (likely but not explicit), `needs_verification` (uncertain — requires user check). The CLI and digest markdown surface these labels visibly.
6. **Memory links must be selective.** Hard caps prevent edge explosion: `backlinks` ≤ 5 per note, `suggested_links` ≤ 10 per digest, BM25 threshold for FTS-resolved links. A wiki with 500 notes should not have 50 000 edges.
7. **Local storage, cloud inference — say so.** Audio files, transcripts, the SQLite DB, and the self-portrait never leave the machine as files. *Content* is sent to the Anthropic API for inference; Anthropic's Commercial Terms §B prohibits training on that content. Stronger requirements (fully offline) defer to the v2 Ollama swap.
8. **The Sense-Maker challenges the prior portrait, not anchors to it.** Self-Anchoring Calibration Drift / sycophancy is the dominant failure mode in iterative-refinement pipelines (per SycEval 2025, SYCON-Bench EMNLP 2025). The plan defends this with both schema shape (`delta.removed`/`delta.weakened`) *and* empirical fixture tests that prove revision actually happens under contradictory evidence.

## Tech Stack Summary

Single source of truth for every technology choice, pinned to the version intended for v1. Rationale lives in Key Technical Decisions; this table is for fast lookup during implementation.

| Layer | Choice | Version | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Runtime | Node.js | `>=22 <25` | better-sqlite3 12.x has known build issues on Node 25 ([#1411](https://github.com/WiseLibs/better-sqlite3/issues/1411)). SDK supports Node 18+ but better-sqlite3 is the binding constraint. |
| Language | TypeScript | `^5.9` | Strict + NodeNext modules |
| Build | tsc | `^5.9` | Plain `tsc` for the standalone repo; no need for tsgo |
| Lint/Format | Biome | `^2.3.5` | Single-config formatter + linter |
| Test | Vitest | `^3.2` | Common Node testing stack |
| Agent SDK | Claude Agent SDK (`@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`) | `^0.2.133` | Native Claude tool use + structured output; bundled Claude Code subprocess; Anthropic-only by design |
| Schema validation | Zod | `^4.4` | Runtime + types; bridged to SDK via `z.toJSONSchema(YourSchema)` for `outputFormat` |
| Default model — Reframer / Librarian / Quizmaster | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | — | Fast structured extraction at $1/$5 per MTok; per-note latency-sensitive |
| Default model — Sense-Maker | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | — | Multi-document reasoning + evidence-cited claims; 1M ctx; $3/$15 per MTok; can flip to `claude-opus-4-7` if synthesis quality demands |
| Database | SQLite via better-sqlite3 | `^12.9` | Synchronous, single-writer, FTS5 support, zero ops |
| Full-text search | SQLite FTS5 | (built-in) | Content-table for notes; trigram tokenizer for entities |
| Schema migrations | `PRAGMA user_version` + `migrations/NNN_*.sql` | (in-house, ~15 LOC) | No standard better-sqlite3 migration lib in 2026; canonical pattern is numbered SQL files + `user_version` ([gluer.org](https://gluer.org/blog/sqlites-user_version-pragma-for-schema-versioning/)). Avoids 30-50 MB ORM dep. |
| Mic capture | `ffmpeg` (subprocess) | system `>=6.0` | `-f avfoundation` on macOS; replaces unmaintained `node-record-lpcm16` |
| STT | nodejs-whisper (whisper.cpp) | latest | Local, free, anti-hallucination flags; default model `base.en` |
| Audio compression | `ffmpeg libopus` | system | ~10× smaller than WAV; 30-day retention sweep |
| Subprocess | execa | `^9` | ffmpeg / sox driver |
| In-process scheduler | croner | `^9` | DST-safe; node-cron deliberately rejected |
| Out-of-process scheduler | macOS launchd | system | Survives sleep via `RunAtLoad`; primary on macOS |
| CLI | commander | `^14` | Subcommand shape |
| Concurrency limiter | p-limit | `^7` | Whisper transcribe mutex |
| Advisory file lock | `proper-lockfile` | `^4` | Cross-process digest mutex at `~/.voice-wiki/.digest.lock` |
| Env loading | dotenv | `^16` | `.env` for `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` etc. |

**Stack decisions intentionally rejected:**

- **Vercel AI SDK** — was the v1 choice in the prior plan revision; replaced by Claude Agent SDK after deciding to commit to Anthropic-only and accept the resulting simplification (drop the provider-isolation module, drop the runtime model-routing layer, use SDK-native structured output and tool registration).
- **Convex / Supabase / Postgres** — overkill for single-user local data; SQLite is the right footprint.
- **pgvector / sqlite-vec / embeddings** — connections work via tags + FTS-resolved backlinks + trigram entities. Defer until proven insufficient.
- **Drizzle / Prisma / Knex** — 7 tables of straightforward SQL; raw `better-sqlite3` is simpler and the migration overhead is 15 lines of glue.
- **node-cron** — DST bugs, no missed-run replay across Mac sleep.
- **node-record-lpcm16** — unmaintained (last release 2018). Use ffmpeg directly.
- **Next.js / React / Tailwind / React Flow** — no UI in v1.
- **Pi (`pi-agent-core`)** — interactive-loop framework; this is a background pipeline. Reused as inspiration only.
- **Deepgram / AssemblyAI / OpenAI Whisper API** — local whisper.cpp is sufficient; cloud STT defers privacy and cost.

**Stack decisions deferred (not rejected) — see "Deferred to Follow-Up Work":**

- **Ollama / local LLM swap.** Structurally fine for the Reframer (Llama 3.1 8B + JSON-Schema-constrained output via llama.cpp grammar); not at semantic parity with Sonnet 4.6 for the Sense-Maker as of 2026-05. Revisit when local models close the synthesis gap.

---

## Cost Projection

A power user (50 voice notes / week, daily Sense-Maker, daily Quizmaster) at 2026 Anthropic API pricing:

| Agent | Model | Tokens/call (in/out) | Calls/mo | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Reframer | Haiku 4.5 ($1/$5) | 2K / 1.5K | 217 | ~$2.06 |
| Sense-Maker | Sonnet 4.6 ($3/$15) | 30K / 5K | 30 | ~$4.95 |
| Quizmaster | Haiku 4.5 ($1/$5) | 5K / 1.5K | 30 | ~$0.38 |
| Librarian disambiguation | Haiku 4.5 ($1/$5) | <1K / <0.5K | <30 | <$0.10 |
| **Total** | | | | **~$7.50 / month** |

**This is the *uncached* worst case.** The Claude Agent SDK does not currently expose `cache_control` for custom system prompts ([sdk#626](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python/issues/626) — open as of 2026-03), so contractual cache discounts are not assumed. If/when the SDK exposes ephemeral cache markers, the same workload is estimated at ~$3.90/mo.

**Threshold to revisit model selection:** monthly spend > $30 *or* `voice-wiki status` shows >2% `error_max_structured_output_retries` rate.

**Flip Sense-Maker → Opus 4.7** ($5/$25) only on synthesis-quality grounds (cost flip $4.95 → ~$8.25/mo is unimportant; latency flip ~2× matters for interactive `voice-wiki digest`).
**Flip Reframer → Sonnet 4.6** ($1/$5 → $3/$15) only if grounding-label accuracy is systematically off on the fixture set, or if `error_max_structured_output_retries` exceeds ~2%.

## Requirements

- R1. Capture mic audio on demand from the CLI; one recording session = one note.
- R2. Transcribe locally via whisper.cpp (open-source STT; no cloud STT in v1).
- R3. Reframe each transcript into structured output: cleaned text, summary, key points, claim/evidence/question/action chunks, tags, entities, backlink hints, and an interpretation layer.
- R4. Persist notes in SQLite with three connection types — tags, wiki-style backlinks, entity-extracted relations — and FTS5 search.
- R5. Run a Sense-Maker on a configurable schedule (default daily) that emits structured insights (themes, contradictions, open questions, suggested missing links, learnings, opportunities, choices-pending) and updates a single living self-portrait with evidence-cited claims.
- R6. Fire-and-forget ingest: a note is filed without human-in-the-loop review.
- R7. Crash-safe ingest: a process exit between transcription and filing must be recoverable on next startup; partial state must be visible.
- R8. Audio retention: encode WAV to Opus on transcription success; delete files older than a configurable retention window (default 30 days).
- ~~R9. Multi-provider portability~~ — *dropped in 2026-05-08 deepening pass; Anthropic-only by design (see Summary, Key Technical Decisions).*
- R10. Retrieval practice: a `voice-wiki review` command surfaces evidence-grounded recall questions over the accumulated wiki, requires the user's answer before reveal, and records a confidence rating. Closes the capture → understand → practice loop.
- R11. Provenance labels: every Reframer chunk and entity carries a `grounding` label (`from_notes` / `inferred` / `needs_verification`); Sense-Maker insights propagate or recompute the label. CLI output and digest markdown surface the label visibly.
- R12. **Privacy boundary.** Audio, transcripts, the SQLite DB, the self-portrait, and any derived markdown stay on the local filesystem and are never uploaded *as files*. Inference is cloud (Anthropic API). DB and `.env` files are mode `0600`. A configurable redaction regex (`VW_REDACT_PATTERNS`) strips obvious secret-shaped tokens from `cleaned_text` and `raw_transcript` before any API call.
- R13. **Calibration validation.** The system includes empirical fixture tests that prove the Sense-Maker revises (or weakens) prior self-portrait claims when new evidence undermines them — not just schema enforcement of `delta.removed`/`delta.weakened`. See U10 test scenarios for the canonical six.

---

## Scope Boundaries

- No embeddings or vector search in v1. Connections are tag + FTS-resolved backlink + entity-extracted only.
- No importer for existing markdown / Obsidian / Granola corpora in v1.
- No web or mobile UI; CLI only. No Slack/email digest delivery.
- No fully-offline mode in v1. The CLI requires a working Anthropic API key; storage stays local but inference does not. Stronger requirements defer to the v2 Ollama swap.
- No pi extension wrapper for an interactive "talk to my wiki" mode.
- No human-in-the-loop review queue for Reframer interpretations.
- No multi-user, sharing, or encryption-at-rest in v1. (DB is mode `0600` but not encrypted; users wanting at-rest encryption should use FileVault / a LUKS volume / equivalent.) **The v2 product is a hosted multi-tenant SaaS — see Deferred to Follow-Up Work.**
- No diarization (single user; one speaker assumed).
- No multi-provider abstraction. Anthropic only.

### Deferred to Follow-Up Work

- `voice-wiki import` for existing markdown corpora — separate plan.
- pi extension wrapper that exposes `query_graph` to the pi coding agent — separate plan.
- Embeddings + `sqlite-vec` for semantic similarity — separate plan, only if FTS-only proves insufficient.
- **Ollama / local LLM swap** — separate plan once local models reach Sonnet-4.6-grade synthesis on the fixture digests. Drop-in replacement at the Sense-Maker is the highest bar; the Reframer would land first.
- **MCP-fed ingest** (Granola transcripts, Notion pages, Calendar events flowing alongside voice notes). The Claude Agent SDK supports MCP servers via one `mcpServers` option entry; adding another stream is a config change in v2, not a rewrite.
- **Hosted multi-tenant SaaS (v2 product)** — public sign-up + billing + auth + per-tenant isolation. Separate plan once v1 validates the agent loop and self-portrait calibration. v2 plan addresses: Postgres + FTS substitute (`tsvector` / `pg_trgm`), browser `MediaRecorder` audio capture + S3-ish upload, server-side or cloud STT (whisper.cpp on a worker, or Whisper API / Deepgram), queue worker for digests (BullMQ / SQS / Cloud Tasks), auth/billing (e.g. Clerk + Stripe), data-processor compliance posture (DPA / SOC2 / GDPR). The four-agent core and `types.ts` schemas are forward-compatible by design; the local-only pieces are explicitly v1-only.

---

## Context & Research

### Relevant Code and Patterns

- The package is standalone (resolved 2026-05-08); no host monorepo wiring needed.
- *External reference reading (not imports):* if pi's Agent class or `createAgentSession` are useful as inspiration for how a stateful tool-calling loop is shaped in TypeScript, those files live in the public `pi-mono` repo (`packages/agent/src/agent.ts`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/sdk.ts`). voice-wiki does not depend on pi.

- **node-cron limitations** — [DST issue #509](https://github.com/node-cron/node-cron/issues/509). No missed-run replay across process sleep. Use macOS `launchd` (out-of-process) for the daily digest; in-process scheduler optional and uses `croner`, not node-cron.
- **launchd sleep coalescing** — [launchd.info](https://www.launchd.info/) confirms missed `StartCalendarInterval` events while asleep are coalesced into a single fire on wake.
- **node-record-lpcm16 is unmaintained** (last release 2018). Spawn `ffmpeg -f avfoundation` directly for mic capture; avoids the `sox` brew dep.
- **Self-Anchoring Calibration Drift** — when models iterate on their own prior outputs, confidence inflates. Sense-Maker must challenge prior self-portraits, not anchor to them.

---

## Key Technical Decisions

- **Stack: Claude Agent SDK + Anthropic-only.** Confirmed against three product priorities: (1) ship a usable v1 quickly, (2) v1 is background-only — record/ingest/digest plus a retrieval-practice CLI, no interactive chat or MCP ingest, (3) accept Anthropic lock-in in exchange for the smallest API surface and the privacy posture of Anthropic Commercial Terms §B. The four "agents" are `query()` calls with `outputFormat: { type: 'json_schema' }` — the SDK's native structured-output primitive maps to the use case one-to-one. See [Framework comparison](#framework-comparison-claude-agent-sdk-vs-vercel-ai-sdk-vs-pi) below for the trade-off matrix.
- **Default models pinned by agent.** Reframer / Librarian disambiguation / Quizmaster → `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` (fast, cheap, structured-extraction-capable). Sense-Maker → `claude-sonnet-4-6` (multi-document reasoning + 1M context). `claude-opus-4-7` reserved for future Sense-Maker upgrade if synthesis quality demands.
- **Pin Node `>=22 <25`.** better-sqlite3 12.x has known build issues on Node 25; SDK supports 18+ but better-sqlite3 is the binding constraint.
- **Structured output via SDK `outputFormat`.** Every agent uses `query({ prompt, options: { outputFormat: { type: 'json_schema', schema: z.toJSONSchema(SchemaName) } } })`. The result arrives as `m.structured_output` on the result message; we run a final `SchemaName.safeParse(...)` for strict TS narrowing. Validation failure after SDK retries surfaces as `result.subtype === 'error_max_structured_output_retries'` — mapped to a `failed` row in `notes`, *not* a transient retry.
- **Prompt caching is opaque in current SDK** ([sdk#626](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python/issues/626)). `ClaudeAgentOptions` does not expose `cache_control`. With a custom `systemPrompt: string`, voice-wiki receives no contractual cache discount. Cost projections assume uncached. Revisit when SDK exposes cache markers.
- **Disable `settingSources` for batch use.** Pass `options.settingSources: []` so the SDK does not load `CLAUDE.md` / `.claude/` from the cwd. This is a CLI batch worker, not a coding agent.
- **Bound every call.** Each `query()` call sets `maxTurns` (1 for Reframer/Quizmaster/Librarian, 4 for Sense-Maker step a with tool use) and optionally `maxBudgetUsd` as a hard guardrail. Iterate the AsyncGenerator; act only on the terminal `result` message.
- **Pass lightweight references between agents.** The orchestrator hands the Sense-Maker `{noteId, summary≤200chars, top_tags[≤3], top_entities[≤5]}`, not full transcripts. Anchor with the **last 3 self-portrait deltas** so the interpretation layer is calibrated to who the user has been saying they are.
- **Cap chain depth at 2 LLM steps.** Reframer + Librarian-disambiguation (conditional). Sense-Maker is its own pipeline (1 tool call + structured-output for InsightsSchema; 1 standalone for SelfPortraitSchema). Resist adding an "entity-disambiguator agent" later.
- **Drop `node-record-lpcm16`; spawn `ffmpeg -f avfoundation` directly** for mic capture. Modern, maintained, already required for Opus encoding.
- **VAD + `temperature: 0` + `--no-speech-threshold 0.7` on every transcription.** Non-negotiable; whisper hallucinates on silence and personal monologues have lots of pauses.
- **Suppress interpretation when transcript < 30 words.** Highest-risk hallucination surface; short notes don't have enough signal to interpret.
- **FTS5 trigram tokenizer for entity disambiguation.** Default tokenizer mishandles voice-transcribed name variants. Add `entities_fts USING fts5(name, tokenize='trigram')`.
- **Entity disambiguator column.** `entities` UNIQUE is `(name, type, disambiguator)`, where `disambiguator` is a free-text hint like "Sam from work". Reframer optionally returns `context_hint`; Librarian uses it to pick existing entity vs create new.
- **Cap backlinks per note at 5; cap suggested_links per digest at 10.** Prevents edge explosion in long-running graphs.
- **Self-portrait claims must cite note IDs.** `SelfPortraitSchema.claims` is `Array<{statement, evidence_note_ids[]}>`. Any uncited claim is rewritten as "Insufficient evidence yet for X."
- **Sense-Maker challenges the prior self-portrait, not anchors to it — and we test it.** Mitigates Self-Anchoring Calibration Drift. `delta` is `{added, weakened, removed}`, not just "what's new". *Empirical* enforcement via 6 fixture tests in U10 (sycophancy resistance × 2, calibration retention, insufficient-evidence honesty, no-change fairness, depersonalization probe).
- **Three anti-sycophancy prompt techniques in the Sense-Maker prompt.** (a) **Question-reframing prior claims** — render the seed/prior portrait as `"Is it still true that X?"` not `"X is true."`; AISI 2026 closes the sycophancy gap by ~24pt with this single move. (b) **Depersonalize the prior** — strip `I`/`my` markers; render as `"The user has previously claimed X"`; SYCON-Bench reports up to 63.8% reduction. (c) **Optional separate-critic pass** — a second `query()` call whose only job is to produce `{claims_to_remove, claims_to_weaken, reason}` *before* the synthesis pass. Doubles digest tokens; defensible because Sense-Maker is once-daily.
- **Atomicity at the chunk level.** `InsightsSchema.themes[].evidence_chunk_ids` references `note_chunks`, not whole notes. Aligns with Matuschak's evergreen-notes principle.
- **Status state machine on `notes`.** `transcribed → reframed → filed → failed`. Reframer crash leaves a recoverable row; Librarian wraps everything in one `db.transaction()`. Recovery uses optimistic locking (`UPDATE … WHERE status=?` + `changes() === 1`) so two concurrent recover-ers can't double-claim the same row.
- **Distinguish transient errors from validation errors.** `result.subtype` discrimination: `success` (use `structured_output`); `error_max_structured_output_retries` → mark `failed`, do not retry; `error_max_turns` / `error_max_budget_usd` → mark `failed`; `error_during_execution` → bounded retry on transient (HTTP 429/5xx/timeouts). Network/auth errors throw from the AsyncGenerator and are caught with the same retry policy.
- **Cross-process concurrency: WAL + `busy_timeout=5000` + advisory file lock for digest.** WAL allows readers + one writer; `busy_timeout` covers the schedule-vs-listen and double-recover races; an advisory file lock at `~/.voice-wiki/.digest.lock` prevents manual `voice-wiki digest` racing the cron'd one (which would write two near-identical `self_portraits` rows and anchor on each other).
- **Schema migrations via `PRAGMA user_version` + numbered SQL files.** No ORM. ~15 LOC of glue in `db/client.ts` reads `user_version`, applies any `migrations/NNN_*.sql` with version > current inside a single `db.transaction()`. Files end with `PRAGMA user_version = N;`. Never edit shipped migrations; add a new one.
- **Privacy at rest: `chmod 0600` on DB and `.env`.** SQLite's WAL/SHM sidecars inherit the parent file's mode under a 022 umask, so a 0600 main file produces 0600 sidecars. `client.ts` enforces this on startup.
- **Privacy in flight: redaction regex.** `VW_REDACT_PATTERNS` (default `password|api[_-]?key|secret|token|bearer`) strips obvious secret-shaped tokens from `cleaned_text` and `raw_transcript` before any `query()` call. The redaction is applied to the *prompt* sent to the API, not to the stored row — the raw transcript is sacred.
- **Scheduler: macOS `launchd` is the v1 recommendation** for the daily digest (survives sleep, has `RunAtLoad` catchup). Ship a `.plist` template + `voice-wiki schedule` as the in-process fallback (uses `croner`, not node-cron).
- **Hot DB backups via `db.backup()` weekly.** Second launchd job runs `VACUUM INTO '~/.voice-wiki/backups/notes-YYYY-MM-DD.db'` weekly; retain 4 weeks. Startup runs `PRAGMA integrity_check`; if anything other than `ok`, refuse to start and instruct the user to restore from backup.

### Framework comparison: Claude Agent SDK vs Vercel AI SDK vs pi

|  | **Claude Agent SDK (chosen)** | **Vercel AI SDK (alternative)** | **pi (pi-agent-core)** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Providers | Anthropic only | OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, +many | Multi (via pi-ai) |
| Agent loop | Built-in (`query()` AsyncGenerator) | None — caller writes the loop | `Agent` class with state/events |
| Sub-agent primitive | Built-in (`options.agents` + `Agent` tool) | None | None (subprocess example) |
| Tool calling | `tool()` + `createSdkMcpServer()` + Zod | `tool()` + Zod | `Tool` + TypeBox |
| Structured output | `outputFormat: { type: 'json_schema' }` + Zod via `z.toJSONSchema` | `generateObject(schema)` | Via `pi-ai.complete` |
| MCP integration | Native (`mcpServers` option) | Limited | None |
| Prompt caching | Opaque in current SDK ([sdk#626](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python/issues/626)) | Manual `cacheControl: ephemeral` markers | Manual |
| Provider lock-in | Anthropic only | None | None |
| Designed for | Coding agents w/ tools, MCP, schemas | Structured extraction, pipelines, RAG | Interactive coding sessions w/ TUI |

**Why Claude Agent SDK wins for voice-wiki v1:**

- The four "agents" map to the SDK's `query()` + `outputFormat` primitive directly. Reframer/Quizmaster/Librarian are single-turn structured-output calls (`maxTurns: 1`); Sense-Maker step (a) is one tool call + structured output (`maxTurns: 4`); Sense-Maker step (b) is single-turn.
- v1 is background-only with no provider portability requirement. The Vercel AI SDK's biggest win — multi-provider abstraction — is architecturally irrelevant here. Trading provider lock-in for SDK ergonomics is a net win at this scope.
- The Anthropic Commercial Terms §B "no training on Customer Content" framing is a *product affordance* — committing to Anthropic-only lets us state that in the README without hedging. Multi-provider would force a more cautious privacy claim.
- MCP-fed ingest in v2 (Granola, Notion, Calendar) becomes a one-line `mcpServers` config addition rather than a framework rewrite.

**Trade-offs accepted:**

- **Anthropic outage is a single point of failure.** No same-day swap to OpenAI / Google. Mitigation: orchestrator queues `transcribed` rows in the DB; Sense-Maker skips a day silently; `voice-wiki status` surfaces last-success and last-error timestamps; a v2 flip to a multi-provider abstraction is non-trivial but not architecturally blocked.
- **Caching is opaque.** Cost projections assume uncached. Revisit when SDK exposes `cache_control`.
- **Subprocess overhead.** `query()` spawns the bundled Claude Code subprocess per call. Acceptable for once-per-note + once-per-day cadence; not acceptable for an interactive REPL (out of scope).

**When the recommendation would flip:**

- **Use Vercel AI SDK instead** if v1 included provider portability as a hard requirement (e.g., enterprise procurement, multi-vendor procurement constraint, or guaranteed cloud-agnostic deployment). Trade: write the agent loop yourself, manage cache markers per-vendor, lose native MCP.
- **Use pi instead** if v1 included an interactive `voice-wiki chat` mode where the user converses with their wiki. Pi's TUI, session tree, and `Agent` class become load-bearing rather than overhead.

Both deferred to v2 per Scope Boundaries.

## Open Questions

### Resolved During Planning

- *Which agent SDK?* — Claude Agent SDK (see Key Technical Decisions). Replaces the prior plan's Vercel AI SDK choice after committing to Anthropic-only.
- *Note granularity?* — One recording session = one note (locked from clarification).
- *Local vs hosted LLM?* — Hosted (Anthropic) for v1; Ollama swap deferred to v2 (in Deferred to Follow-Up Work).
- *Audio retention?* — Opus, 30 days, configurable.
- *Confirmation loop?* — Fire-and-forget. No queue.
- *Default model assignment?* — Per-agent pinning in `src/llm/models.ts`. Reframer/Librarian/Quizmaster on Haiku 4.5; Sense-Maker on Sonnet 4.6; Opus 4.7 reserved.

### Resolved 2026-05-08

- **Host repo retargeting.** Resolved in favor of **standalone at `~/Developer/sensemaking-agents/voice-wiki/`** (not a monorepo, not re-cloned pi-mono). Rationale: v2 is a hosted SaaS that will live in its own server-side codebase, so a v1 monorepo would only ever hold one package. All file paths in this plan are now relative to `voice-wiki/` (the package root) and no `packages/` prefix is used.
- **Product trajectory.** Resolved: v1 is local CLI; v2 is hosted multi-tenant SaaS with sign-up + billing (separate plan). See Summary and Deferred to Follow-Up Work.

### Deferred to Implementation

- Exact Reframer / Sense-Maker prompt wording — refine during U8 / U10 implementation against real recordings.
- BM25 threshold for backlink resolution — start at `bm25 < -2`, calibrate empirically during U9.
- Whisper model choice (`base.en` vs `small.en` vs `large-v3-turbo`) — default `base.en`; revisit during U6 if accuracy is too low for personal monologue style.
- Exact retry backoff schedule for Anthropic 429s/5xx — start `[1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s]` with ±20% jitter; honor `retry-after` header. Tune in U8.
- Whether to flip Sense-Maker from Sonnet 4.6 → Opus 4.7 — default Sonnet for v1; benchmark on a real digest in U10 and swap if synthesis quality on the calibration fixtures justifies latency.
- Whether to ship the optional separate-critic pass for the Sense-Maker — default off in v1; enable via `VW_SENSEMAKER_CRITIC=1` if calibration tests flag drift on real data.

## Implementation Units

### Phase 0 — Lock the demo with fixture transcripts

- U0. **Fixture transcripts and seed self-portraits**

  **Goal:** Anchor every downstream unit's tests against representative transcripts and seed self-portraits — including the canonical 6 calibration fixtures the Sense-Maker calibration tests depend on. Adapted from Study Scribe's "lock the demo" Phase 0: the product becomes legible (and testable) before any code is written.

  **Requirements:** Foundational for R3, R5, R7, R10, R13.

  **Dependencies:** None.

  **Files:**
  - Create: `voice-wiki/test/fixtures/transcripts/01_short_thought.txt` (~15 words; exercises interpretation-suppression guard)
  - Create: `voice-wiki/test/fixtures/transcripts/02_meeting_recap.txt` (~250 words; multi-entity, single topic; contains the "ship in 2 weeks" claim)
  - Create: `voice-wiki/test/fixtures/transcripts/03_rambling_multitopic.txt` (~600 words; tests session-as-note + chunk extraction)
  - Create: `voice-wiki/test/fixtures/transcripts/04_contradiction.txt` (~200 words; deliberately contradicts fixture 02 — "actually 2 weeks isn't realistic anymore")
  - Create: `voice-wiki/test/fixtures/transcripts/05_open_question.txt` (~150 words; ends mid-thought; tests `tutor_prompts` and `open_questions`)
  - Create: `voice-wiki/test/fixtures/self_portraits/seed_v0.md` (a "version 0" self-portrait with claims that fixtures 02/04 will validate or contradict — used as the prior in the calibration tests)
  - Create: `voice-wiki/test/fixtures/self_portraits/seed_v0_with_unsupported_claim.md` (asserts a claim no fixture mentions — used by the insufficient-evidence honesty test)
  - Create: `voice-wiki/test/fixtures/self_portraits/seed_v0_first_person.md` (same content as seed_v0 but in I/my form — used by the depersonalization probe)

  **Approach:**
  - Each transcript is a representative voice-note style: rambling sentences, mid-thought drops, repeated names, light contradiction.
  - Transcript 04 must contain a claim that fixture 02 also generates, but stated oppositely (e.g., 02: "I think we should ship the API in two weeks"; 04: "Actually I'm not sure two weeks is realistic anymore"). This drives the contradiction-detection and sycophancy-resistance tests in U10.
  - Transcript 05 must end with a literal question or unfinished phrase ("…but I haven't figured out whether…") so Reframer's `chunks` includes a `question` typed entry and Sense-Maker's `tutor_prompts` triggers.
  - `seed_v0.md` includes 3-5 claims of varying support: at least one that fixture 02 reinforces, at least one that fixture 04 contradicts, and at least one that no fixture touches. The other two seeds are variants for specific calibration fixtures.

  **Patterns to follow:**
  - n/a — pure content authoring.

  **Test scenarios:**
  - Test expectation: none — fixtures are inputs to other tests, not testable themselves. A `test/fixtures/README.md` documents what each fixture is for.

  **Verification:**
  - All 5 transcripts and all 3 seed self-portraits exist and are readable plain text/markdown.
  - U8 / U10 / U14 / U15 tests reference these fixtures by relative path.
  - The U10 calibration test file (`sensemaker-calibration.test.ts`) compiles without missing-fixture errors.

---

### Phase 1 — Foundation

- U1. **Workspace package scaffold**

  **Goal:** Land the empty `voice-wiki/` package as a standalone repo at `~/Developer/sensemaking-agents/voice-wiki/`.

  **Requirements:** Structural prerequisite for all units.

  **Dependencies:** None.

  **Files:**
  - Create: `voice-wiki/package.json` (name: `voice-wiki`; deps: `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk@^0.2.133`, `zod@^4`, `better-sqlite3@^12`, `nodejs-whisper`, `croner@^9`, `commander@^14`, `execa@^9`, `dotenv@^16`, `p-limit@^7`, `proper-lockfile@^4`; devDeps: `typescript@^5.9`, `vitest@^3.2`, `@biomejs/biome@^2.3.5`; engines: `node@>=22 <25`; bin entry: `voice-wiki: ./dist/cli.js`.)
  - Create: `voice-wiki/tsconfig.json` (standalone; target ES2022, module NodeNext, strict, declaration, outDir `dist`, rootDir `src`)
  - Create: `voice-wiki/biome.json` (formatter + linter)
  - Create: `voice-wiki/vitest.config.ts`
  - Create: `voice-wiki/.gitignore` (`node_modules/`, `dist/`, `*.tsbuildinfo`)
  - Create: `voice-wiki/.env.example` (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `VW_DIGEST_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-6`, `VW_DIGEST_CRON='0 8 * * *'`, `VW_RETENTION_DAYS=30`, `VW_RETENTION_CRON='0 3 * * *'`, `VW_BACKUP_CRON='0 4 * * 0'`, `VW_DATA_DIR`, `VW_WHISPER_MODEL=base.en`, `VW_REDACT_PATTERNS=password|api[_-]?key|secret|token|bearer`, `VW_SENSEMAKER_CRITIC=0`, `VW_MAX_AUDIO_GB=10`)
  - Create: `voice-wiki/README.md` (setup: `brew install ffmpeg`, `npx nodejs-whisper download base.en`, env vars, commands, ending with `voice-wiki doctor`)
  - Test: none for U1.

  **Approach:**
  - Initialize as a standalone repo: `git init`, `npm init -y`, then write the configs above.
  - `npm install` must succeed; `npm run check` (Biome + `tsc --noEmit`) must pass with empty src.
  - `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` bundles the Claude Code binary as an optional dependency — no separate install.

  **Patterns to follow:**
  - Standard Node 22 LTS package layout with TypeScript + Biome + Vitest.

  **Test scenarios:**
  - Test expectation: none — pure scaffolding, no behavior.

  **Verification:**
  - `npm install` from the repo root succeeds.
  - `npm run check` from `voice-wiki/` exits 0.
  - `npm run build` from `voice-wiki/` exits 0 (empty `src/` is fine, tsc no-op).

- U2. **SQLite schema, migrations, client, and query helpers**

  **Goal:** Persistent storage with FTS5, a `PRAGMA user_version`-based migration loop, the status state machine, idempotent transaction-bounded write helpers, busy-timeout-tuned WAL pragmas, and `chmod 0600` enforcement.

  **Requirements:** R4, R7, R12.

  **Dependencies:** U1.

  **Files:**
  - Create: `voice-wiki/migrations/001_init.sql`
  - Create: `voice-wiki/migrations/README.md`
  - Create: `voice-wiki/src/db/client.ts` (open DB, apply pragmas, run migrate(), enforce 0600)
  - Create: `voice-wiki/src/db/queries.ts`
  - Create: `voice-wiki/src/db/locks.ts`
  - Test: `voice-wiki/test/db.test.ts`
  - Test: `voice-wiki/test/migrate.test.ts`

  **Approach:**
  - Schema (final shape — written into `migrations/001_init.sql`, ending with `PRAGMA user_version = 1;`):
    - `notes(id, raw_transcript, cleaned_text NULL, summary NULL, interpretation NULL, audio_path, audio_format, duration_ms, status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'transcribed' CHECK (status IN ('transcribed','reframing','reframed','filing','filed','failed')), error_message TEXT, created_at)` — note the addition of transient `'reframing'` and `'filing'` states for optimistic-claim concurrency control.
    - `note_chunks(id, note_id FK, chunk_type CHECK (claim|evidence|question|action), text, position, stance, grounding TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'from_notes' CHECK (grounding IN ('from_notes','inferred','needs_verification')))`
    - `entities(id, name, type CHECK (person|project|concept|tag), disambiguator TEXT NULL, grounding TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'from_notes' CHECK (grounding IN ('from_notes','inferred','needs_verification')), UNIQUE(name, type, disambiguator))`
    - `note_entities(note_id, entity_id, relation, PRIMARY KEY(...))`
    - `note_links(source_note_id, target_note_id, edge_type, confidence REAL, PRIMARY KEY(...))`
    - `digests(id, period_start, period_end, insights_json, markdown_path, created_at)`
    - `self_portraits(id, version, body, claims_json TEXT NOT NULL, delta_json TEXT NOT NULL, source_digest_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES digests(id), created_at)`
    - `retrieval_questions(id, source_chunk_id INTEGER NULL REFERENCES note_chunks(id), source_note_id INTEGER NULL REFERENCES notes(id), question TEXT NOT NULL, expected_answer TEXT, question_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (question_type IN ('short_answer','application','self_explanation','flashcard')), difficulty TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (difficulty IN ('easy','medium','hard')), generated_at INTEGER NOT NULL, generated_by_digest_id INTEGER NULL REFERENCES digests(id))` — at least one of `source_chunk_id` / `source_note_id` must be non-null (CHECK constraint)
    - `review_attempts(id, retrieval_question_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES retrieval_questions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE, user_answer TEXT, self_rating TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (self_rating IN ('unknown','shaky','solid')), feedback TEXT, created_at)`
    - `notes_fts USING fts5(summary, cleaned_text, content='notes', content_rowid='id', tokenize='porter unicode61')` + INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE triggers (canonical 3-trigger set per SQLite docs)
    - `entities_fts USING fts5(name, tokenize='trigram')` + corresponding triggers on `entities`
    - Indexes on `note_chunks(note_id)`, `note_entities(note_id|entity_id)`, `note_links(source|target)`, `notes(status, created_at)`, `retrieval_questions(source_chunk_id)`, `retrieval_questions(source_note_id)`, `review_attempts(retrieval_question_id, created_at)`
  - **Migration loop in `client.ts`:** read `db.pragma('user_version', { simple: true })`; scan `migrations/*.sql` numbered `NNN_name.sql`; for each file with `N > current`, run inside `db.transaction(() => { db.exec(sql); })`; the file ends by setting `PRAGMA user_version = N` itself (defense-in-depth). Files are idempotent only at the file boundary — never edit shipped migrations; always add a new one. ~15 LOC of glue.
  - **Pragmas applied at every connection open:** `journal_mode=WAL`, `synchronous=NORMAL`, `foreign_keys=ON`, `busy_timeout=5000`, `cache_size=-20000`, `temp_store=MEMORY`.
  - **Privacy enforcement on startup:** `fs.chmodSync(dbPath, 0o600)`; if `~/.voice-wiki/.env` exists, `fs.chmodSync(envPath, 0o600)`. WAL/SHM sidecars inherit the mode.
  - **Integrity check on startup:** `db.pragma('integrity_check', { simple: true })` must return `'ok'`; otherwise refuse to start with a clear "restore from `~/.voice-wiki/backups/`" message.
  - `queries.ts` exports typed helpers: `insertDraftNote`, `claimForReframing(noteId)` (optimistic `UPDATE … WHERE status='transcribed'` returning `changes() === 1`), `updateNoteToReframed`, `claimForFiling`, `updateNoteToFiled`, `updateNoteToFailed`, `upsertEntity`, `lookupEntityByName` (uses `entities_fts MATCH`), `linkNotes`, `getRecentSummaries(n)`, `getRecentSelfPortraitDeltas(3)`, `findResumableNotes()`, `searchNotesFts(query)`. Each write helper is internally `db.transaction()`-wrapped where it spans multiple statements.
  - `locks.ts` wraps `proper-lockfile` for the digest mutex: `acquireDigestLock(): Promise<{ release(): Promise<void> }>` against `~/.voice-wiki/.digest.lock`. Throws on already-held with a clear "another digest run is in progress" message.
  - **No `INSERT … RETURNING`** on `notes` or `entities` — use `lastInsertRowid` from `prepare(...).run()`.

  **Patterns to follow:**
  - SQLite docs canonical FTS5 external-content triggers (3-trigger set).
  - SQLite migration patterns ([gluer.org](https://gluer.org/blog/sqlites-user_version-pragma-for-schema-versioning/), [levlaz.org](https://levlaz.org/sqlite-db-migrations-with-pragma-user_version/)).
  - Existing monorepo TS style (Biome formatted).

  **Test scenarios:**
  - **Happy path:** `insertDraftNote → claimForReframing → updateNoteToReframed → claimForFiling → updateNoteToFiled` advances `status` correctly; `findResumableNotes()` returns rows in `'transcribed'` and `'reframed'` only.
  - **Happy path:** `upsertEntity('Sam','person',null)` then `upsertEntity('Sam','person','from work')` creates two distinct rows.
  - **Happy path (migrate):** Empty DB → `migrate()` → `user_version === 1`; schema present; running `migrate()` again is a no-op.
  - **Happy path (migrate forward):** Stage a synthetic `migrations/002_test_add_column.sql` that adds a column and bumps to 2; run `migrate()` from `user_version=1`; assert the column exists and `user_version === 2`.
  - **Edge case:** `lookupEntityByName('Whisper.cpp')` finds an existing `'WhisperCPP'` entity via trigram FTS.
  - **Edge case:** Inserting a note with `summary='hello world'` then deleting it leaves `notes_fts` empty (DELETE trigger fires).
  - **Edge case:** Updating `summary` regenerates FTS row (UPDATE trigger fires).
  - **Edge case:** Two parallel `claimForReframing(id)` calls — exactly one returns true (`changes() === 1`); the other returns false. Optimistic-claim concurrency.
  - **Edge case:** Startup with a DB whose mode is `0644` is auto-chmod'd to `0600` and proceeds.
  - **Edge case:** Startup with `PRAGMA integrity_check` returning anything other than `'ok'` exits non-zero with a restore-from-backup message.
  - **Error path:** `linkNotes(1, 2, 'refines')` then re-running silently no-ops via `INSERT OR IGNORE` (PK enforces idempotency).
  - **Error path:** Inserting `note_entities` with an unknown `entity_id` fails with FK error (foreign_keys is ON).
  - **Integration:** `db.transaction(() => { ... throw })` rolls back fully — verify `notes` count unchanged after a forced throw mid-transaction.
  - **Integration:** Re-opening the DB after a crash mid-transaction shows no partial state.
  - **Integration (cross-process):** Spawn two child processes; one runs `librarian.fileNote(noteA)`, the other runs a no-op `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` write; assert both complete without `SQLITE_BUSY` thanks to `busy_timeout=5000`.

  **Verification:**
  - `sqlite3 ~/.voice-wiki/notes.db ".schema"` returns the full schema with all 3 FTS5 triggers per content table.
  - `sqlite3 ~/.voice-wiki/notes.db "PRAGMA user_version;"` returns `1` after first run.
  - All test scenarios pass.

- U3. **LLM models, query wrapper, and redaction**

  **Goal:** A small typed surface over the Claude Agent SDK plus pre-send redaction. Replaces the prior plan's multi-provider isolation module with a much smaller Anthropic-only shape.

  **Requirements:** R3, R5, R12.

  **Dependencies:** U1.

  **Files:**
  - Create: `voice-wiki/src/llm/models.ts`
  - Create: `voice-wiki/src/llm/query.ts`
  - Create: `voice-wiki/src/llm/redact.ts`
  - Test: `voice-wiki/test/llm-query.test.ts`
  - Test: `voice-wiki/test/redact.test.ts`

  **Approach:**
  - `models.ts` exports pinned model IDs:
    - `REFRAMER_MODEL = 'claude-haiku-4-5-20251001'`
    - `LIBRARIAN_MODEL = 'claude-haiku-4-5-20251001'`
    - `QUIZMASTER_MODEL = 'claude-haiku-4-5-20251001'`
    - `SENSEMAKER_MODEL = process.env.VW_DIGEST_MODEL ?? 'claude-sonnet-4-6'` (single override env var; constrains to known IDs at startup)
  - `query.ts` exports `runStructuredQuery<T>(opts: { prompt, schema: ZodSchema<T>, model, systemPrompt, mcpServers?, allowedTools?, maxTurns?, maxBudgetUsd? }): Promise<{ ok: true; data: T } | { ok: false; reason: 'parse' | 'turns' | 'budget' | 'transient' | 'fatal'; subtype?: string; cause?: unknown }>`. Internally:
    - Calls `query({ prompt, options: { model, systemPrompt, settingSources: [], outputFormat: { type: 'json_schema', schema: z.toJSONSchema(opts.schema) }, allowedTools: opts.allowedTools ?? [], mcpServers: opts.mcpServers ?? {}, maxTurns: opts.maxTurns ?? 1, maxBudgetUsd: opts.maxBudgetUsd } })`.
    - Iterates the AsyncGenerator; acts only on `m.type === 'result'`.
    - Discriminates `subtype`: `'success'` → `opts.schema.safeParse(m.structured_output)` (returns `{ok: true, data}` if valid; `{ok: false, reason: 'parse', subtype}` if not — should be rare since the SDK pre-validated structurally).
    - `'error_max_structured_output_retries'` → `{ok: false, reason: 'parse', subtype}` (do not retry; orchestrator marks `failed`).
    - `'error_max_turns'` / `'error_max_budget_usd'` → `{ok: false, reason: 'turns' | 'budget', subtype}`.
    - `'error_during_execution'` and thrown errors → classify via cause: HTTP 429 / 5xx / `ETIMEDOUT` → `{ok: false, reason: 'transient'}`; auth/4xx → `{ok: false, reason: 'fatal'}`.
    - The caller wraps `'transient'` returns in their own backoff loop (different schedules per agent).
  - `redact.ts` exports `redact(text: string, patterns: RegExp[] = DEFAULT_PATTERNS): string` that replaces matches with `[REDACTED]`. `DEFAULT_PATTERNS` is parsed from `VW_REDACT_PATTERNS` (semicolon-separated regex list). Applied to `cleaned_text` and `raw_transcript` *only* before sending to the API — the stored row is never modified.
  - **API key validation on first call:** the SDK throws `AuthenticationError` if `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is missing or wrong. `runStructuredQuery` catches and rewrites to a clear "Set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in .env" `{ok: false, reason: 'fatal', cause: ...}` return.

  **Patterns to follow:**
  - Claude Agent SDK structured outputs ([docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/structured-outputs)).

  **Test scenarios:**
  - **Happy path:** `runStructuredQuery({prompt: '…', schema: ReframeSchema, model: REFRAMER_MODEL, systemPrompt: REFRAMER_SYSTEM, maxTurns: 1})` against a mocked SDK returning a `result` with `subtype: 'success'` and a valid `structured_output` returns `{ok: true, data: <Reframe>}`.
  - **Edge case:** Mocked `subtype: 'error_max_structured_output_retries'` returns `{ok: false, reason: 'parse'}` — caller does not retry.
  - **Edge case:** Mocked `subtype: 'error_max_turns'` returns `{ok: false, reason: 'turns'}`.
  - **Edge case:** SDK `AuthenticationError` returns `{ok: false, reason: 'fatal'}` with a remediation message.
  - **Edge case:** SDK transient error (HTTP 429) returns `{ok: false, reason: 'transient'}`; caller is responsible for retry.
  - **Edge case:** `redact('my password is hunter2', [/password/i])` returns `'my [REDACTED] is hunter2'`.
  - **Edge case:** Empty `VW_REDACT_PATTERNS` env var disables redaction (passes through unchanged).
  - **Edge case:** Malformed `VW_REDACT_PATTERNS` regex throws at module load with a clear error, not a silent miss.
  - **Edge case:** Schema bridging — `z.toJSONSchema(ReframeSchema)` produces a JSON Schema the SDK accepts (smoke test that no Zod feature blocks the bridge).
  - **Edge case:** `SENSEMAKER_MODEL` defaults to `claude-sonnet-4-6`; setting `VW_DIGEST_MODEL=claude-opus-4-7` flips it.

  **Verification:**
  - All scenarios pass.
  - `runStructuredQuery` typings are inferred end-to-end (caller does not need to cast).

- U4. **Shared types and Zod schemas**

  **Goal:** Single source of truth for all agent contracts.

  **Requirements:** R3, R5, R10, R11.

  **Dependencies:** U1.

  **Files:**
  - Create: `voice-wiki/src/types.ts`
  - Test: `voice-wiki/test/types.test.ts`

  **Approach:**
  - Shared `Grounding = z.enum(['from_notes','inferred','needs_verification'])`. Used on every extracted chunk and entity.
  - `ReframeSchema`: `cleaned_text`, `summary`, `key_points: z.array(z.string()).max(10)`, `interpretation` (may be empty string), `chunks: z.array(z.object({type, text, stance?, grounding: Grounding})).min(1)`, `tags: z.array(z.string()).max(8)`, `entities: z.array(z.object({name, type, relation, grounding: Grounding, context_hint: z.string().optional()})).max(15)`, `backlinks: z.array(z.object({target_hint, edge_type})).max(5)`.
  - `InsightsSchema`: `themes: z.array(z.object({title, evidence_chunk_ids: z.array(z.number().int()).min(1), body}))`, `contradictions`, `open_questions`, `suggested_links: z.array(...).max(10)`, `learnings`, `opportunities`, `choices_pending`, `tutor_prompts: z.array(z.object({source_note_id: z.number().int(), what_seems_unresolved: z.string(), question_to_ask_yourself: z.string()})).max(5)` — surfaces shaky reasoning for the user to revisit.
  - `SelfPortraitSchema`: `body: z.string()`, `claims: z.array(z.object({statement, evidence_note_ids: z.array(z.number().int()).min(1)}))`, `delta: z.object({added: z.array(z.string()), weakened: z.array(z.string()), removed: z.array(z.string())})`.
  - `RetrievalQuestionsSchema`: `questions: z.array(z.object({question_type: z.enum(['short_answer','application','self_explanation','flashcard']), question, expected_answer: z.string().optional(), difficulty: z.enum(['easy','medium','hard']), source_chunk_id: z.number().int().nullable(), source_note_id: z.number().int().nullable()})).min(1).max(10)`. At least one source field non-null per question (refined via `.refine()`).
  - `DisambiguationSchema = z.object({chosen_id: z.number().int().nullable(), confidence: z.number().optional()})` — used by Librarian.
  - All schemas exported as `Reframe`, `Insights`, `SelfPortrait`, `RetrievalQuestions`, `Disambiguation` TS types via `z.infer`.
  - **Smoke test the JSON-Schema bridge:** for each schema, run `z.toJSONSchema(SchemaName)` and assert the result is non-empty and contains expected top-level fields. Catches any Zod construct the SDK won't accept.

  **Test scenarios:**
  - **Happy path:** Sample valid `ReframeSchema` payload parses cleanly with `grounding` populated on every chunk/entity.
  - **Happy path:** `InsightsSchema` accepts a `tutor_prompts` array of length 0 to 5.
  - **Happy path:** `RetrievalQuestionsSchema` accepts a flashcard-typed entry with `expected_answer` set.
  - **Happy path:** `z.toJSONSchema(InsightsSchema)` yields a JSON Schema with the expected `themes`, `contradictions`, etc. top-level keys.
  - **Edge case:** `backlinks` of length 6 fails `.max(5)`.
  - **Edge case:** `tutor_prompts` of length 6 fails `.max(5)`.
  - **Edge case:** `claims[0].evidence_note_ids` empty array fails `.min(1)`.
  - **Edge case:** `chunks` empty fails `.min(1)`.
  - **Edge case:** `themes[0].evidence_chunk_ids` empty array fails `.min(1)` (atomicity rule).
  - **Edge case:** `grounding` value `'maybe'` fails enum check.
  - **Edge case:** `RetrievalQuestionsSchema` entry with both source fields null fails `.refine()`.
  - **Edge case:** `DisambiguationSchema` accepts `{chosen_id: null}` (signals "create new").

  **Verification:**
  - All test scenarios pass.
  - Type inference (`type Reframe = z.infer<typeof ReframeSchema>`) produces the expected fields including `grounding`.

### Phase 2 — Audio pipeline

- U5. **Mic capture (ffmpeg avfoundation)**

  **Goal:** Record 16 kHz mono WAV from the default mic; clean Ctrl+C stop; in-memory or file output.

  **Requirements:** R1.

  **Dependencies:** U1.

  **Files:**
  - Create: `voice-wiki/src/audio/recorder.ts`
  - Test: `voice-wiki/test/recorder.test.ts` (skips on CI / no-mic env)

  **Approach:**
  - Spawn `ffmpeg -hide_banner -loglevel error -f avfoundation -i ":default" -ac 1 -ar 16000 -acodec pcm_s16le -y <out.wav>` via `execa`.
  - Expose `startRecording(outPath): { stop(): Promise<{durationMs:number}> }`. `stop()` sends `SIGINT` and waits for ffmpeg exit.
  - **Pre-flight disk check:** before spawning, `statfs` the data dir; refuse to start if free space < 500 MB. Fail fast with a clear "free up disk space" message.
  - Document: first run prompts for mic permission for the parent terminal app (Terminal/iTerm/VS Code).
  - Hard fail with a clear message if `ffmpeg` is not on PATH.

  **Patterns to follow:**
  - `execa` subprocess management; SIGINT-based graceful stop.

  **Test scenarios:**
  - **Happy path:** Spawning with a fake `--list-devices` flag and reading stderr confirms ffmpeg-on-PATH probe works.
  - **Error path:** `startRecording('/dev/null/cannot-write')` rejects with a path error.
  - **Error path:** `ffmpeg` missing produces a clear "install via `brew install ffmpeg`" error message.
  - **Error path:** Pre-flight disk check with mocked `<500 MB` free refuses to start with a remediation message.
  - **Integration:** End-to-end mic test is `it.skip`-gated by `VW_TEST_MIC=1` env to allow local-only verification.

  **Verification:**
  - On a Mac with mic permission, `voice-wiki listen` produces a non-empty 16 kHz mono WAV.

- U6. **Transcription (nodejs-whisper + VAD)**

  **Goal:** WAV → transcript with anti-hallucination flags and explicit chunking for long sessions.

  **Requirements:** R2.

  **Dependencies:** U1.

  **Files:**
  - Create: `voice-wiki/src/audio/transcribe.ts`
  - Test: `voice-wiki/test/transcribe.test.ts`
  - Test fixture: `voice-wiki/test/fixtures/audio/short_clean.wav` (~10 sec)

  **Approach:**
  - Single export: `transcribe(wavPath, opts?: {model?: string; language?: string}): Promise<{text: string, segments: Segment[], durationMs: number}>`.
  - Calls `nodejs-whisper.nodewhisper` with: `modelName: VW_WHISPER_MODEL` (default `base.en`), `whisperOptions: { outputInJson: true, wordTimestamps: false, language: 'en', vad: true, vadMinSilenceDurationMs: 500, noSpeechThreshold: 0.7, temperature: 0, suppressBlank: true }`, `removeWavFileAfterTranscription: false`.
  - **Process-wide mutex** (`p-limit(1)`) so two concurrent transcriptions never race on the model file.
  - **Startup model-file check** in `client.ts`: if `~/.cache/whisper/ggml-base.en.bin` is missing, `voice-wiki` exits 1 with a single-line fix: `voice-wiki doctor --install-whisper`.
  - For sessions > 5 min: pre-segment using ffmpeg `silenceremove` to extract speech segments, transcribe each, stitch.
  - Drop segments where the same line repeats > 2× consecutively (long-silence hallucination filter).

  **Patterns to follow:**
  - `nodejs-whisper` README; whisper.cpp VAD flags.

  **Test scenarios:**
  - **Happy path:** Transcribing `short_clean.wav` returns non-empty text plus ≥ 1 segment.
  - **Edge case:** Calling `transcribe` twice in parallel serializes (mutex) — both complete, neither corrupts the other.
  - **Edge case:** A WAV that's all silence returns text length ≤ a small threshold (no "Thank you for watching"-style hallucination).
  - **Error path:** Missing model file triggers download attempt; if download fails, throws a clear error with remediation.
  - **Error path:** Missing model file with `VW_NO_AUTO_DOWNLOAD=1` exits 1 immediately with the doctor remediation.
  - **Integration:** A 6-minute fixture (gated by `VW_TEST_LONG=1`) is split, transcribed in parts, and stitched without dropping audible content at boundaries.

  **Verification:**
  - All ungated test scenarios pass on every test run; long-form scenario passes locally.
  - Manual: speak 10 sec into `voice-wiki listen`, confirm reasonable transcript (no "Thank you for watching").

- U7. **Audio compression and retention**

  **Goal:** Encode WAV → Opus on transcription success; sweep files older than retention window; bound WAL size.

  **Requirements:** R8.

  **Dependencies:** U1.

  **Files:**
  - Create: `voice-wiki/src/audio/compress.ts`
  - Create: `voice-wiki/src/scheduler/retention.ts`
  - Test: `voice-wiki/test/compress.test.ts`

  **Approach:**
  - `encodeOpus(wavPath): Promise<string>` — runs `ffmpeg -i in.wav -c:a libopus -b:a 24k -y out.opus`, deletes original WAV, returns Opus path. Updates `notes` row's `audio_format='opus'`.
  - `runRetentionSweep({retainDays})` — walks `~/.voice-wiki/audio/`, deletes files with `mtime < now - retainDays*86400`, also nulls `notes.audio_path` for affected rows. Additionally enforces `VW_MAX_AUDIO_GB` hard cap by deleting oldest-first if total audio exceeds the cap.
  - **WAL truncation:** retention sweep also runs `db.pragma('wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)')` to bound WAL file growth.
  - All file ops use absolute paths derived from `config.dataDir`.

  **Test scenarios:**
  - **Happy path:** A 5-sec WAV encodes to Opus ~10× smaller; original is deleted.
  - **Edge case:** Already-Opus file is left alone (no double-encode).
  - **Edge case:** `VW_MAX_AUDIO_GB=0.001` (1 MB) with 10 MB of audio prunes oldest files until under cap.
  - **Error path:** Missing ffmpeg throws a clear error.
  - **Integration:** Retention sweep with `retainDays=0` (test override) deletes a file with `mtime` 1 day in the past; updates `notes.audio_path` to NULL; runs WAL checkpoint.

  **Verification:**
  - All scenarios pass.

### Phase 3 — Agents and orchestration

- U8. **Reframer agent**

  **Goal:** Single-shot structured-output `query()` call with bounded retry, interpretation suppression, and pre-send redaction.

  **Requirements:** R3, R12.

  **Dependencies:** U2, U3, U4.

  **Files:**
  - Create: `voice-wiki/src/agents/reframer.ts`
  - Create: `voice-wiki/src/agents/reframer-prompt.md` (system prompt + few-shot)
  - Test: `voice-wiki/test/reframer.test.ts`

  **Approach:**
  - Function: `reframe(transcript: string, ctx: ReframeContext): Promise<Reframe>`.
  - `ReframeContext` carries: `recentSummaries: Array<{id, summary, top_tags, top_entities}>` (≤ 10), `recentSelfPortraitDeltas: string[]` (≤ 3, joined). Pulled via `db/queries.ts`.
  - **Pre-send redaction:** `redact(transcript)` is what's actually sent to the API. The stored `raw_transcript` is *never* modified.
  - System prompt = `reframer-prompt.md`, passed as a plain string. Includes the word-count guard rule and the grounding-label disambiguation guidance.
  - Calls `runStructuredQuery({ prompt: redactedTranscript + ctx, schema: ReframeSchema, model: REFRAMER_MODEL, systemPrompt: REFRAMER_SYSTEM, maxTurns: 1, maxBudgetUsd: 0.10 })`.
  - **Word-count guard:** if `transcript.split(/\s+/).length < 30`, force `interpretation: ""` post-hoc (also instructed in the prompt).
  - **Bounded transient retry around the call:** 5 attempts on `{ok: false, reason: 'transient'}`, exponential backoff `[1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s]` with ±20% jitter; honor `retry-after` header if present in the cause. `{ok: false, reason: 'parse' | 'turns' | 'budget' | 'fatal'}` is *not* retried — caller (orchestrator) marks the note `failed`.
  - Result on success: schema-validated `Reframe` object.

  **Patterns to follow:**
  - Claude Agent SDK `query()` with `outputFormat` ([docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/structured-outputs)).

  **Test scenarios:**
  - **Happy path:** A 200-word transcript returns a `Reframe`-valid object with non-empty interpretation.
  - **Happy path:** A 15-word transcript returns `interpretation === ""` (word-count guard).
  - **Happy path (redaction):** A transcript containing `"my password is hunter2"` is sent as `"my [REDACTED] is hunter2"`; the `raw_transcript` row is unmodified.
  - **Edge case:** A transcript with no clear claim still produces ≥ 1 `chunks` entry (Zod `.min(1)` enforced by SDK + post-validation).
  - **Edge case:** `backlinks.length === 0` is allowed (max 5, no min).
  - **Error path:** Mocked `{reason: 'transient'}` 429 retries 5× with the expected backoff, then succeeds.
  - **Error path:** Mocked `{reason: 'parse'}` (the SDK's `error_max_structured_output_retries`) is not retried; throws `ReframeFailedError`.
  - **Error path:** Mocked `{reason: 'budget'}` is not retried; throws `ReframeFailedError` with `subtype` preserved.

  **Verification:**
  - All scenarios pass.

- U9. **Librarian (deterministic + 1 disambiguation LLM call)**

  **Goal:** Take Reframer output and a noteId; insert chunks/entities/links inside one transaction; resolve backlinks via FTS5 BM25; resolve entity name conflicts via trigram FTS + (rarely) one structured-output `query()` call.

  **Requirements:** R4, R7.

  **Dependencies:** U2, U3, U4.

  **Files:**
  - Create: `voice-wiki/src/agents/librarian.ts`
  - Test: `voice-wiki/test/librarian.test.ts`

  **Approach:**
  - Function: `file(noteId: number, reframe: Reframe): Promise<{linksWritten: number; entitiesUpserted: number}>`.
  - Caller (orchestrator) has already taken `claimForFiling(noteId)` optimistic lock. Wrapped in `db.transaction(() => { ... })`:
    1. Insert `note_chunks` rows (preserve order in `position`).
    2. For each `entities[]`:
       - Look up via `entities_fts MATCH name`. If no match → insert new row.
       - If 1 exact `(name, type)` match with same/null `disambiguator` → reuse.
       - If multiple ambiguous matches and `context_hint` is provided → call `runStructuredQuery({ prompt, schema: DisambiguationSchema, model: LIBRARIAN_MODEL, systemPrompt: DISAMBIG_SYSTEM, maxTurns: 1, maxBudgetUsd: 0.02 })` passing top-3 candidates; if `chosen_id === null`, create new with `disambiguator = context_hint`.
       - Insert `note_entities`.
    3. For each `backlinks[]`:
       - Run `notes_fts MATCH target_hint ORDER BY bm25(notes_fts) LIMIT 5`.
       - If top hit `bm25 < -2.0` (configurable) → insert `note_links` with confidence derived from BM25 rank.
       - If multiple candidates above threshold → 1 disambiguation `query()` call.
       - Else drop silently.
    4. Update `notes.status = 'filed'`.
  - Hard caps from schema (`backlinks.max(5)`) prevent edge explosion at the source.
  - **Idempotency:** before insert, `DELETE FROM note_chunks WHERE note_id=?; DELETE FROM note_entities WHERE note_id=?; DELETE FROM note_links WHERE source_note_id=?`. Re-running `file()` for the same `noteId` is safe (idempotent).
  - Disambiguation transient retries follow the same `[1s,2s,4s,8s,16s]` policy as Reframer.

  **Patterns to follow:**
  - SQLite `bm25()` ranking; better-sqlite3 `db.transaction()` semantics.

  **Test scenarios:**
  - **Happy path:** A `Reframe` with 3 chunks, 2 entities, 1 backlink hint that exactly matches one existing note → produces 3 chunk rows, 2 entity rows, 1 link row, and `notes.status='filed'`.
  - **Happy path (disambiguation):** Two existing `(Sam, person)` rows (one disambiguator NULL, one "from work"); new entity has `context_hint: 'from college'` → one disambiguation `query()` call returning `{chosen_id: null}` → new row created with `disambiguator='from college'`.
  - **Happy path (disambiguation reuse):** Same setup but disambiguation returns `{chosen_id: <existing>}` → no new row.
  - **Edge case:** Backlink hint with no FTS match drops silently; final link count is 0.
  - **Edge case:** Backlink hint matching the source note's own summary is filtered (no self-loops).
  - **Error path:** Transaction throw mid-loop (mock disambiguation call rejects fatally) leaves zero new rows in `notes_fts`, `note_chunks`, `note_entities`, `note_links` for this `noteId`.
  - **Error path:** Re-running `file()` for the same `noteId` after a successful run is idempotent — it deletes existing chunks/entities/links for this note first, then re-inserts. Final row counts equal.
  - **Integration:** After 50 ingests with 5 backlinks each, no note has > 5 outbound links (cap holds end-to-end).

  **Verification:**
  - All scenarios pass.

- U10. **Sense-Maker (with empirical calibration tests)**

  **Goal:** Two structured-output `query()` calls — `InsightsSchema` over chunks (with a `query_graph` tool), then `SelfPortraitSchema` that demonstrably challenges the prior portrait — both transactionally written behind an advisory file lock. The 6 fixture-based calibration tests are the load-bearing differentiator: they prove the system revises rather than anchors.

  **Requirements:** R5, R13.

  **Dependencies:** U2, U3, U4, U0 (fixtures).

  **Files:**
  - Create: `voice-wiki/src/agents/sensemaker.ts`
  - Create: `voice-wiki/src/agents/sensemaker-prompt.md`
  - Test: `voice-wiki/test/sensemaker.test.ts`
  - Test: `voice-wiki/test/sensemaker-calibration.test.ts` — the 6 anti-sycophancy fixtures

  **Approach:**
  - `runDigest({ since: Date, until: Date, write: boolean }): Promise<DigestResult>`.
  - **Acquire `~/.voice-wiki/.digest.lock`** via `proper-lockfile` for the entire run; release in `finally`. Manual `voice-wiki digest` and the cron'd one cannot race.
  - **Step 1 — Insights:**
    - Define a `query_graph` tool via `tool('query_graph', '...', {since, until, tags?, entities?}, async handler => ({content: [{type:'text', text: JSON.stringify(rows)}]}))` where `rows` is the joined `note_chunks + notes + entities + edges` for the time window.
    - Wrap in `createSdkMcpServer({ name: 'voice-wiki-graph', version: '1.0.0', tools: [queryGraph] })`.
    - Tool result size capped at ~50 KB; if exceeded, time-bucket the response (split into half-windows and let the model call the tool twice).
    - `runStructuredQuery({ prompt, schema: InsightsSchema, model: SENSEMAKER_MODEL, systemPrompt: INSIGHTS_SYSTEM, mcpServers: { 'voice-wiki-graph': graphServer }, allowedTools: ['mcp__voice-wiki-graph__query_graph'], maxTurns: 4, maxBudgetUsd: 0.50 })`.
    - Prompt explicitly directs the model to populate `tutor_prompts` with shaky reasoning the user did not finish thinking through (per Core Principle 3 — "Confusion is valuable") and to mark inferred-but-unsupported claims as such.
  - **Step 2 — SelfPortrait (with anti-sycophancy techniques applied):**
    - Read previous `self_portraits.body` + `claims_json` + last 3 deltas via `getRecentSelfPortraitDeltas`.
    - **Apply question-reframing** (AISI 2026): for each prior claim, render to the prompt as `"Is it still true that <statement>? — previously cited <evidence_note_ids>"` rather than `"<statement> is true."`
    - **Apply depersonalization** (SYCON-Bench 2025): strip `I`/`my`/`me` markers from the prior portrait body; render as `"The user has previously claimed …"`.
    - **Optional separate-critic pass** (gated by `VW_SENSEMAKER_CRITIC=1`, default off): a prior `runStructuredQuery` call against a `CriticSchema = z.object({claims_to_remove: ..., claims_to_weaken: ..., reason: z.string()})` whose only job is to find at least one weakening or removal — empty list requires a one-line justification. The synthesis call then receives the critic's output as additional context.
    - `runStructuredQuery({ prompt, schema: SelfPortraitSchema, model: SENSEMAKER_MODEL, systemPrompt: PORTRAIT_SYSTEM, maxTurns: 1, maxBudgetUsd: 0.30 })`.
    - Prompt frames: *"Identify any prior claim no longer supported. Identify newly emerging claims. Cite note IDs for every claim. Write 'Insufficient evidence yet for X' rather than asserting unsourced. Per Claude's Constitution, prefer honest revision over agreement with prior outputs."*
  - **Step 3 (if `write`):** Single `db.transaction()`:
    - Insert `digests` row.
    - Insert `self_portraits` row with `version = max(version)+1` (or 1 if first), `source_digest_id` set.
    - Write markdown to `~/.voice-wiki/digests/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
    - Trigger U15 Quizmaster (within the same lock window).
  - Bounded transient retry on each `runStructuredQuery`; `parse | turns | budget | fatal` are not retried — entire digest is logged as failed and the run aborts before write.
  - **Empty-window guard:** if `query_graph` returns 0 rows for the time window, skip both steps and return an empty digest; do NOT bump self-portrait version.

  **Patterns to follow:**
  - Claude Agent SDK tool-use + structured output ([MCP integration](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/mcp)).
  - U3 `runStructuredQuery` wrapper.

  **Test scenarios (sensemaker.test.ts — schema and shape):**
  - **Happy path:** A fixture DB with 5 notes (tags, chunks, links) → digest produces ≥ 1 theme citing ≥ 2 `evidence_chunk_ids`; self-portrait v1 with ≥ 3 claims, each with `evidence_note_ids.length ≥ 1`.
  - **Happy path:** Running `runDigest` again on the same fixture bumps `self_portraits.version` to 2; `delta.added` is non-empty or `delta.removed` is non-empty (some change recorded — see calibration tests for stronger assertions).
  - **Edge case:** Empty time window (no notes in range) → returns a digest with all empty arrays; does NOT bump self-portrait version.
  - **Edge case:** A claim without `evidence_note_ids` is rejected by Zod `.min(1)` and triggers a `parse` failure (not retried).
  - **Edge case:** `query_graph` tool result > 50 KB triggers the time-bucket fallback; insights still produced.
  - **Edge case:** Held lock in a sibling process → `runDigest` fails fast with a clear "another digest run is in progress" message.
  - **Integration:** Transaction abort during `self_portraits` insert leaves no `digests` row either (single transaction).
  - **Integration:** With `VW_SENSEMAKER_CRITIC=1`, the critic call runs first and its output appears in the synthesis prompt context.

  **Test scenarios (sensemaker-calibration.test.ts — the load-bearing 6):**
  - **Edge case (sycophancy resistance, direct contradiction):** Seed v0 portrait asserts the "ships in 2 weeks" claim; ingest fixture 02 (reaffirms 2-week ship) then fixture 04 (explicit contradiction); run digest → assert `delta.weakened` OR `delta.removed` contains a string matching `/2 ?weeks|ship|timeline/i` AND the new portrait body does NOT contain an unhedged "ships in 2 weeks" claim.
  - **Edge case (sycophancy resistance, indirect erosion):** Seed v0 portrait asserts "user is energized by greenfield work"; ingest a fixture where every note describes maintenance/debugging tedium with no greenfield mention; run digest → assert `delta.weakened` references the greenfield claim. Detects silent retention of unsupported claims.
  - **Edge case (calibration retention, confirmation):** Seed v0 portrait asserts a claim X; ingest fixture 02 which corroborates X; run digest → assert claim X persists in the new portrait AND its `evidence_note_ids` array grew (cite count increased). Detects silent dropping of confirmed claims.
  - **Edge case (insufficient-evidence honesty):** Use `seed_v0_with_unsupported_claim.md` asserting "user prefers async communication"; ingest fixtures with ZERO mention of communication style; run digest → assert the claim either (a) survives unchanged with original `evidence_note_ids`, or (b) is moved to weakened — but NEVER appears in `delta.added` with new note IDs it doesn't actually cite. Test counts `evidence_note_ids` before/after and asserts no NEW IDs were attached to this claim.
  - **Edge case (no-change assertion fairness):** Run digest twice on identical input (same prior portrait, same notes); assert `v(n+1).delta.added.length === 0` AND `v(n+1).delta.removed.length === 0`. Detects "synthetic novelty" sycophancy.
  - **Edge case (depersonalization probe):** Run two digest passes — one with `seed_v0_first_person.md` (I/my form), one with `seed_v0.md` (depersonalized). If `delta.removed` differs significantly between runs, the model is anchoring to first-person framing (an empirically known sycophancy amplifier per AISI 2026). Run as a calibration check; flag a soft warning rather than failing the suite (high noise).

  **Verification:**
  - All schema/shape scenarios pass.
  - All 6 calibration scenarios pass on the pinned `claude-sonnet-4-6` snapshot. If a future model regresses, the test catches it before deploy.
  - `voice-wiki status` reports last successful digest timestamp.

- U11. **Orchestrator**

  **Goal:** Glue. Drives the per-session flow with the status state machine, optimistic-claim recovery, and crash-safe resume.

  **Requirements:** R6, R7.

  **Dependencies:** U2, U6, U7, U8, U9.

  **Files:**
  - Create: `voice-wiki/src/agents/orchestrator.ts`
  - Test: `voice-wiki/test/orchestrator.test.ts`

  **Approach:**
  - `ingestFromAudio(audioPath)` and `ingestFromText(text)` — both produce a `noteId`.
  - State machine (using transient `'reframing'` and `'filing'` states for optimistic claim):
    1. Insert draft note (`status='transcribed'`) capturing `raw_transcript` (text path) or `audio_path` (audio path).
    2. (Audio path) Transcribe → store `raw_transcript`.
    3. `claimForReframing(noteId)` → if `changes() === 0`, another worker has claimed it; abort.
    4. Reframer → on success, `updateNoteToReframed` with cleaned_text/summary/interpretation.
    5. `claimForFiling(noteId)` → optimistic claim again.
    6. Librarian.file() → transaction sets `status='filed'`.
    7. (Audio path) Compress WAV → Opus → update `audio_format`.
  - On startup (`resumeOrphans()`): `findResumableNotes()` → for each, attempt the appropriate `claimFor*` and proceed. Lost-claim rows are handled by a different worker.
  - Errors: Reframer `parse`/`fatal`/`budget` → set `status='failed'`, persist `error_message`. Librarian txn fail → set `status='failed'`. Both surface to stdout but never crash the process.
  - **Role-tagged CLI output** (makes the multi-agent pipeline legible without a UI):
    ```
    [Capture]   recorded 12.4s, transcribed 187 words via base.en (2.1s)
    [Reframer]  3 chunks (2 claim, 1 question), 2 entities, 1 backlink hint  (1.4s, claude-haiku-4-5)
    [Librarian] linked 1 backlink (BM25=-2.3 → "refines"), upserted "Sam (from college)"  (12ms)
    [Filed]     note #47   (interpretation suppressed: <30 words)
    ```
    Each role logs its outcome on completion; durations help the user feel the pipeline. Output is structured (TSV-friendly) on `--quiet`, formatted with light color when stdout is a TTY.

  **Test scenarios:**
  - **Happy path:** `ingestFromText('I think X')` produces a `notes` row with `status='filed'`.
  - **Happy path:** Process exit between Reframer and Librarian leaves a `'reframed'` row; next startup resumes via `claimForFiling` and reaches `'filed'`.
  - **Edge case:** Reframer `{reason: 'parse'}` (max retries) leaves `status='failed'` with `error_message` populated and does not throw to caller.
  - **Edge case:** Librarian transaction abort (mock injected throw) leaves `status='failed'`; no chunks/entities/links written.
  - **Edge case (concurrency):** Spawn two `resumeOrphans()` calls in parallel against the same `transcribed` row; assert exactly one progresses (the other observes `claimForReframing changes()===0` and skips).
  - **Edge case (concurrency):** Spawn `librarian.fileNote(noteA)` and `sensemaker.runDigest()` in parallel; assert both complete without `SQLITE_BUSY` thanks to `busy_timeout=5000`.
  - **Edge case (digest lock):** Hold `~/.voice-wiki/.digest.lock` from a sibling process; assert manual `voice-wiki digest` exits with `EBUSY` rather than running.
  - **Integration:** End-to-end `ingestFromAudio(fixture.wav)` completes from transcribed → reframed → filed → opus, and the WAV is replaced by an Opus file.

  **Verification:**
  - All scenarios pass.

### Phase 4 — Scheduling, Ops, and CLI

- U12. **Scheduler (launchd plist + croner fallback) and weekly backup**

  **Goal:** Reliable daily digest, nightly retention sweep, and weekly DB backup, with launchd as the primary mechanism on macOS.

  **Requirements:** R5, R8, R12 (backup is a privacy-adjacent durability story).

  **Dependencies:** U7, U10.

  **Files:**
  - Create: `voice-wiki/launchd/com.user.voice-wiki.digest.plist.template`
  - Create: `voice-wiki/launchd/com.user.voice-wiki.backup.plist.template`
  - Create: `voice-wiki/src/scheduler/digest.ts`
  - Create: `voice-wiki/src/scheduler/backup.ts`
  - Test: `voice-wiki/test/digest.test.ts`

  **Approach:**
  - **Primary:** launchd plists that run `voice-wiki digest --write` daily at 08:00 (`RunAtLoad=true` for post-sleep catchup; launchd coalesces missed events into one fire on wake) and `voice-wiki backup` weekly Sunday 04:00. README documents `launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.voice-wiki.digest.plist`.
  - **Fallback (in-process):** `voice-wiki schedule` uses `croner` (not node-cron), with `protect: true` to skip overlapping runs. Three CronJobs: `VW_DIGEST_CRON` (`'0 8 * * *'`) → `runDigest`; `VW_RETENTION_CRON` (`'0 3 * * *'`) → `runRetentionSweep`; `VW_BACKUP_CRON` (`'0 4 * * 0'`) → `runBackup`.
  - **Backup implementation:** `runBackup()` calls `db.backup('~/.voice-wiki/backups/notes-YYYY-MM-DD.db')` (better-sqlite3's hot-safe online backup); rotates to keep 4 weeks; logs result.
  - Bounded retry inside each scheduled handler: 3 attempts, `[2 min, 4 min, 8 min]` backoff. Failed runs are logged to stderr; do not retry across days.

  **Patterns to follow:**
  - launchd `StartCalendarInterval` + `RunAtLoad`.
  - `croner` with `protect: true`.
  - better-sqlite3 `db.backup()` ([API docs](https://github.com/WiseLibs/better-sqlite3/blob/master/docs/api.md)).

  **Test scenarios:**
  - **Happy path:** `runDigest({write: true})` invoked from `digest.ts` with mocked Sense-Maker writes a `digests` row + a self-portrait + a markdown file at the expected path.
  - **Happy path (backup):** `runBackup()` produces a valid SQLite file at `~/.voice-wiki/backups/notes-YYYY-MM-DD.db`; opening it and querying `SELECT count(*) FROM notes` returns the same count as the source.
  - **Edge case:** Two scheduled runs overlapping: `protect: true` causes the second to skip cleanly (logs "skipped — previous run still active"). The advisory file lock from U10 is the second line of defense.
  - **Edge case:** Backup rotation with 5 existing files keeps the 4 newest, deletes the oldest.
  - **Error path:** Scheduled handler fails 3× → logs error and exits the handler; next day's run is unaffected.
  - **Integration (in-process):** `VW_DIGEST_CRON='*/2 * * * *' VW_RETENTION_CRON='*/3 * * * *' npm run dev -- schedule` for ~6 minutes produces 2 `digests` rows + ≥ 1 self-portrait version bump + at least one retention-sweep invocation that doesn't delete fresh files.

  **Verification:**
  - All scenarios pass.
  - Manual: `launchctl load …; launchctl start com.user.voice-wiki.digest` produces a digest immediately.

- U13. **CLI**

  **Goal:** User-facing commands.

  **Requirements:** R1, R2, R5, R6, R10.

  **Dependencies:** U5, U6, U10, U11, U12, U16 (doctor).

  **Files:**
  - Create: `voice-wiki/src/cli.ts`
  - Create: `voice-wiki/src/cli/status.ts`
  - Create: `voice-wiki/src/config.ts`
  - Test: `voice-wiki/test/cli.test.ts`

  **Approach:**
  - `commander` with subcommands grouped by product mode (Capture / Understand / Practice / Ops — `--help` groups them visually):

    | Mode | Command | Behavior |
    |---|---|---|
    | Capture | `listen` | Start recorder; Ctrl+C stops, transcribes, ingests. Role-tagged log lines per U11. |
    | Capture | `ingest <file>` | Single-file path (`.wav` / `.m4a` / `.mp3`). Transcribe + ingest. |
    | Capture | `ingest --text "..."` | Skip STT entirely (fastest dev loop). |
    | Understand | `digest [--since <duration>] [--write]` | Default since `24h`. `--write` persists digest + self-portrait + markdown. Acquires `~/.voice-wiki/.digest.lock`. |
    | Understand | `self-portrait [--version N]` | Print latest (or specified) self-portrait. |
    | Understand | `query <text>` | FTS over notes + entities. |
    | Understand | `status` | Last successful digest, last API error, pending `transcribed`/`reframed` row count, audio dir size, days since last backup. |
    | Practice | `review [--n N] [--difficulty easy\|medium\|hard]` | Pick `N` retrieval questions (default 3) and run the answer-before-reveal loop. See U15. |
    | Ops | `schedule` | Long-running in-process scheduler (croner). |
    | Ops | `config` | Print resolved config / data dir / model selections. |
    | Ops | `doctor [--fix]` | 8-step pass/fail/warn checklist. See U16. |
    | Ops | `backup` | Run an immediate `db.backup()` to `~/.voice-wiki/backups/`. |

  - On startup: `orchestrator.resumeOrphans()` runs first. Logs how many resumable notes were found.
  - `config.ts` resolves data dir: `VW_DATA_DIR` → `~/.voice-wiki/`. Creates subdirs lazily (`audio/YYYY/MM/`, `digests/`, `backups/`).
  - `--help` output begins with a 3-line capture/understand/practice summary so a new user immediately sees the loop.
  - First-launch UX: README's first-run instructions end with `voice-wiki doctor` (verifies all dependencies are present and functional before the user wastes time on a broken setup).

  **Test scenarios:**
  - **Happy path:** `voice-wiki ingest --text "hello world"` exits 0 and prints a `noteId`.
  - **Happy path:** `voice-wiki query "hello"` returns the row inserted above.
  - **Happy path:** `voice-wiki status` prints last digest timestamp, queue depth, audio size, last backup age.
  - **Edge case:** No `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set → first command needing the LLM fails with a clear `Set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in .env` message, not a stack trace.
  - **Edge case:** `voice-wiki self-portrait` with no portraits yet prints `No self-portrait yet — run \`voice-wiki digest --write\``.
  - **Integration:** Full end-to-end as in Verification, scripted, exits 0.

  **Verification:**
  - All scenarios pass.

### Phase 5 — Active recall (Practice mode)

- U15. **Quizmaster + review CLI**

  **Goal:** Generate retrieval-practice questions over the accumulated wiki and run an answer-before-reveal review loop. Closes the capture → understand → practice product loop.

  **Requirements:** R10, R11.

  **Dependencies:** U2 (`retrieval_questions`, `review_attempts` tables), U3 (`runStructuredQuery`), U4 (`RetrievalQuestionsSchema`), U10 (digests are the trigger for question generation).

  **Files:**
  - Create: `voice-wiki/src/agents/quizmaster.ts`
  - Create: `voice-wiki/src/agents/quizmaster-prompt.md`
  - Create: `voice-wiki/src/cli/review.ts` (commander subcommand handler)
  - Test: `voice-wiki/test/quizmaster.test.ts`
  - Test: `voice-wiki/test/review-cli.test.ts`

  **Approach:**
  - **Question generation** runs as a fourth step inside `runDigest()` (U10) when `--write` is set, while the digest lock is still held. Single `runStructuredQuery({ schema: RetrievalQuestionsSchema, model: QUIZMASTER_MODEL, systemPrompt: QUIZ_SYSTEM, maxTurns: 1, maxBudgetUsd: 0.05 })`. Input: the digest's `themes[].evidence_chunk_ids` and the chunks themselves. Generates 3–10 questions, mixed types (`short_answer`, `application`, `self_explanation`, `flashcard`), each citing a `source_chunk_id` or `source_note_id`. Persisted into `retrieval_questions` with `generated_by_digest_id` set.
  - **Question selection** for `voice-wiki review`: by default, prefer questions the user has *not* answered yet (no `review_attempts` row), then questions where the most recent `self_rating` was `'unknown'` or `'shaky'` (spaced re-surfacing of weak material). Cap chosen at `--n` (default 3). Filter by `--difficulty` if set.
  - **Review loop** (per question):
    1. Print the question + grounding badge ("from notes" / "inferred").
    2. Read user's free-text answer from stdin (Ctrl+D to skip).
    3. Reveal `expected_answer` (if present) and the source chunk text.
    4. Prompt for self-rating: `[u]nknown / [s]haky / [solid]`.
    5. Insert `review_attempts` row.
  - **No LLM "grading"** in v1. The user self-rates. Optional `--llm-feedback` flag could call `query()` to give brief feedback on the user's answer, but this is gated and off by default to keep the loop fast and honest. Defer to v2.
  - **Provenance display:** every question prints its `grounding` source ("From your notes — chunk #142, note #47") so the user knows whether they're being quizzed on something the wiki actually contains vs an inferred concept.
  - **Failure isolation:** quizmaster's `parse`/`fatal` failure does NOT fail the parent digest run — digest + self-portrait are already committed before quizmaster runs. Failure surfaces in the digest's metadata row as `tutor_questions_failed=true`.

  **Patterns to follow:**
  - U10 `runStructuredQuery` shape.
  - U13 commander conventions for the review subcommand.

  **Test scenarios:**
  - **Happy path (generation):** A fixture digest with 5 themes and 12 chunks → quizmaster produces 3–10 questions, all valid against `RetrievalQuestionsSchema`; every question's source chunk exists in DB.
  - **Happy path (selection):** `selectReviewQuestions({n: 3})` against a DB with 10 unanswered + 5 answered questions returns 3 unanswered.
  - **Happy path (selection re-surface):** When all questions have at least one attempt, selection returns those rated `'unknown'` or `'shaky'` first.
  - **Edge case:** Digest with 0 themes (empty period) generates 0 questions; `voice-wiki review` prints `No questions yet — ingest more notes.`.
  - **Edge case:** Question generation produces a `source_chunk_id` that does not exist (LLM hallucinated an ID) → row is dropped before insert; warning logged.
  - **Error path:** `parse` failure from question-generation step does NOT fail the parent digest; failure logged as `tutor_questions_failed=true` in the digest row's metadata.
  - **Integration:** Full `review` loop in CI (with stdin scripted): 3 questions presented, 3 answers + ratings collected, 3 `review_attempts` rows inserted, exit 0.

  **Verification:**
  - All scenarios pass.
  - Manual: `voice-wiki digest --since 7d --write` then `voice-wiki review` → 3 questions surface, each with a grounding badge; answering all 3 records 3 attempts.

### Phase 6 — Operational health

- U16. **`voice-wiki doctor`**

  **Goal:** A single command that verifies every first-run dependency is present and functional before the user wastes time on a broken setup. Required as a release gate; the README's first-run instructions end with `voice-wiki doctor`.

  **Requirements:** R7 (operational reliability), R12 (privacy enforcement is verifiable).

  **Dependencies:** U1, U2.

  **Files:**
  - Create: `voice-wiki/src/cli/doctor.ts`
  - Test: `voice-wiki/test/doctor.test.ts`

  **Approach:**
  - Pure read-only verification (with a `--fix` flag for the warn-level items only). Eight checks, run in order:
    1. **Node version** — `process.version` matches `>=22 <25` (better-sqlite3 build constraint).
    2. **`ffmpeg` installed** — `execa('ffmpeg', ['-version'])`; report version and `avfoundation` support (`ffmpeg -hide_banner -devices 2>&1 | grep avfoundation`).
    3. **Mic permission** — attempt a 0.1-second silent ffmpeg capture to a temp path; failure means TCC permission needs granting (TCC errors are characteristic).
    4. **Whisper model present** — `fs.statSync('~/.cache/whisper/ggml-base.en.bin')`; report size (~150 MB for `base.en`). `--install-whisper` flag triggers `npx nodejs-whisper download base.en`.
    5. **`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` present and valid** — call `query()` with a 1-token prompt against Haiku; assert success. Truncate key to last 4 chars in any output.
    6. **Data dir + DB writable + 0600 permissions** — `fs.accessSync('~/.voice-wiki', fs.constants.W_OK)` and `fs.statSync(dbPath).mode & 0o777 === 0o600`. `--fix` chmods to 0600.
    7. **DB integrity** — `PRAGMA integrity_check` returns `ok`. Failure is *fail*, not *warn*: refuse to proceed; instruct restore from backup.
    8. **launchd plist installed (optional)** — `launchctl list | grep com.user.voice-wiki.digest`; report loaded/not-loaded but don't fail if missing (in-process croner is the documented fallback).
  - **Output format — pass/fail/warn list with per-row fix hint:**
    ```
    voice-wiki doctor

    [ok]   node              v22.11.0
    [ok]   ffmpeg            7.0.2 (avfoundation supported)
    [ok]   mic permission    granted
    [ok]   whisper model     base.en (147 MB)
    [ok]   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY ********abcd (Haiku ping ok, 142 ms)
    [warn] data dir mode     0644  fix: chmod 0600 ~/.voice-wiki/notes.db   (or rerun with --fix)
    [ok]   db integrity      ok
    [skip] launchd job       not installed (fallback: voice-wiki schedule)

    7 ok, 1 warn, 0 fail
    ```
  - Exit code: `0` if no `[fail]`, `1` if any `[fail]`. `--fix` flag attempts auto-repair for warn-level items (chmod, data-dir create) and re-runs the affected check.

  **Test scenarios:**
  - **Happy path:** Fully-configured environment → all 8 checks pass; exits 0.
  - **Edge case:** Missing `ffmpeg` → fail row with brew install hint; exits 1.
  - **Edge case:** API key set but invalid → fail row with truncated key; exits 1.
  - **Edge case:** DB at mode 0644 → warn row; `--fix` chmods to 0600 and re-checks → ok.
  - **Edge case:** `PRAGMA integrity_check` returns non-`ok` → fail with restore-from-backup hint; exits 1.
  - **Edge case:** `--install-whisper` invokes `npx nodejs-whisper download` and re-checks step 4.
  - **Integration:** `voice-wiki doctor` in CI with all deps mocked passes; mocked-failure cases exit 1 with the expected message strings.

  **Verification:**
  - All scenarios pass.
  - Manual: fresh laptop → `voice-wiki doctor` after each setup step gradually fills in to all-ok.

### Phase 7 — Verification harness

- U14. **End-to-end smoke test**

  **Goal:** A scripted integration test that exercises every layer.

  **Requirements:** all.

  **Dependencies:** U0, U1–U13, U15, U16.

  **Files:**
  - Create: `voice-wiki/test/e2e.test.ts`
  - Reuse: `voice-wiki/test/fixtures/transcripts/01_short_thought.txt` … `05_open_question.txt` (from U0)
  - Create: `voice-wiki/test/fixtures/audio/short_clean.wav` (already present from U6)

  **Approach:**
  - Test 1: `ingest --text` fixtures 02 (meeting recap) and 04 (contradiction) → DB has 2 notes, ≥ 1 link between them, ≥ 1 entity in common.
  - Test 2: `digest --write` → digests row + self-portrait v1 with claims; `tutor_prompts` is populated against fixture 05's open thread; `retrieval_questions` table has ≥ 3 rows.
  - Test 3: `ingest --text` fixture 03 (rambling multitopic) → `digest --write` → self-portrait v2 with non-empty `delta`; insights surface a contradiction citing both fixtures 02 and 04. **Extended assertion:** v2.claims contains NO claim whose statement also appears verbatim in `seed_v0.md` UNLESS that claim's `evidence_note_ids` includes at least one note ID from the freshly-ingested batch. (Catches the "carry forward unchanged + don't re-verify" sycophancy failure end-to-end.)
  - Test 4: kill the process between Reframer and Librarian (inject env-flag `VW_CRASH_AFTER_REFRAME=1`); rerun CLI without flag; orchestrator resumes; final state is `'filed'`.
  - Test 5: `ingest <wavPath>` → status reaches `'filed'`, audio is Opus.
  - Test 6: `voice-wiki review --n 2` with scripted stdin (2 answers + 2 ratings) → 2 `review_attempts` rows inserted; second invocation returns the still-unanswered remainder.
  - Test 7: `ingest --text` fixture 01 (short thought) → resulting note's `interpretation === ""` (word-count guard end-to-end).
  - Test 8: `voice-wiki doctor` smoke — all checks pass against the fixture environment; exits 0.
  - Test 9: `voice-wiki backup` → produces a valid SQLite file under `~/.voice-wiki/backups/`; opening it and counting notes matches source.

  **Patterns to follow:**
  - Repo's existing test patterns (Vitest in other packages).

  **Test scenarios:**
  - **Integration:** Tests 1–9 above. Each is a separate `it(...)`.

  **Verification:**
  - `npm run test` from `voice-wiki/` runs all suites including e2e and exits 0.
  - Manual: `voice-wiki listen` → speak → see plausible note + summary + interpretation; `voice-wiki digest --since 1d --write` → see themes + tutor prompts; `voice-wiki review` → answer 3 questions; `voice-wiki status` shows healthy state.

---

## System-Wide Impact

- **Interaction graph:** Standalone package; no edges into any existing repo. The only outbound runtime interaction is the Anthropic API and the local filesystem (`~/.voice-wiki/`).
- **Error propagation:** All agent errors funnel into `notes.status='failed'` with `error_message`. CLI surfaces failures as exit code 0 + readable stderr; the daemon path (`schedule`) logs and continues.
- **State lifecycle risks:** The `transcribed → reframing → reframed → filing → filed → failed` state machine is the durability boundary. `db.transaction()` in the Librarian is the atomicity boundary. No partial state should be reachable on disk. Optimistic-claim concurrency control (`UPDATE … WHERE status=?` + `changes() === 1`) handles cross-process recover races.
- **Concurrency boundaries:** SQLite WAL allows many readers + one writer. `busy_timeout=5000` covers schedule-vs-listen and double-recover races. Advisory file lock at `~/.voice-wiki/.digest.lock` (acquired by both the cron'd and manual `digest` paths) prevents concurrent self-portrait generation, which would otherwise produce two near-identical rows that anchor on each other.
- **API surface parity:** None. New CLI surface only.
- **Integration coverage:** The most interesting integrations are Orchestrator + DB (state machine resume on startup with optimistic claim), Sense-Maker + DB (transactional digest+self-portrait+quizmaster behind file lock), and the Sense-Maker calibration tests (real-LLM behavioral validation). All have explicit integration scenarios in U10/U11.
- **Unchanged invariants:** Standalone repo — there are no other packages in the same codebase to disturb.

Retry with `[1s,2s,4s,8s,16s]` exponential backoff with ±20% jitter on 429/5xx; honor `retry-after` header. |
| **Self-Anchoring Calibration Drift / sycophancy in self-portrait** | Med | High | Schema enforcement (`delta.removed`/`delta.weakened` arrays exist; `claims[i].evidence_note_ids.min(1)`); prompt frames prior portrait as "to challenge, not anchor"; question-reframing + depersonalization prompt techniques applied (AISI 2026, SYCON-Bench 2025); **6 fixture-based calibration tests in `sensemaker-calibration.test.ts` empirically validate revision behavior** (U10). Optional separate-critic pass (`VW_SENSEMAKER_CRITIC=1`) adds a falsification mandate. |
| **Claude Agent SDK does not expose prompt cache markers ([sdk#626](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python/issues/626))** | Certain (current state) | Low | Cost projections assume uncached (~$7.50/mo for power user — within rounding error). Revisit when SDK exposes `cache_control`. |
| **DB file corrupted** (power loss mid-WAL, disk failure, stray `kill -9`) | Low | High | Weekly `db.backup()` to `~/.voice-wiki/backups/notes-YYYY-MM-DD.db`, retain 4 weeks (U12). On startup, `PRAGMA integrity_check`; if not `ok`, refuse to start with restore-from-backup instructions (U2). |
| **Disk full mid-ingest** | Low | High (silent data loss) | Pre-flight `statfs` before recording; refuse if <500 MB free (U5). 30-day retention sweep + `VW_MAX_AUDIO_GB=10` hard cap with oldest-first deletion (U7). Weekly `wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)`. |
| **Whisper model file missing/deleted** between runs (homebrew cleanup, manual delete) | Low | High (capture broken) | Startup `fs.existsSync` check; if missing, exit 1 with `voice-wiki doctor --install-whisper` hint (U6). Keep audio WAV on disk until transcription succeeds — never delete pre-transcription. |
| whisper.cpp hallucinations on personal monologues | Med | Med | VAD + `temperature: 0` + `noSpeechThreshold: 0.7` + repeat-line filter (U6). |
| Edge explosion in long-running graph | Low | Med | Hard caps at schema (`backlinks.max(5)`, `suggested_links.max(10)`) + BM25 threshold (U9). |
| Voice-transcribed entity name variants ("Sam" vs "Sammy") collide or fragment | Med | Low | `entities_fts` trigram tokenizer + optional `disambiguator` column + 1 conditional disambiguation `query()` call (U2, U9). |
| node-cron DST bugs / missed runs across Mac sleep | n/a | n/a | Primary scheduler is launchd plist (`RunAtLoad=true` covers post-sleep catchup; launchd coalesces missed events). In-process fallback uses `croner`, not node-cron. |
| `node-record-lpcm16` is unmaintained | n/a | n/a | Use `ffmpeg avfoundation` directly (U5). |
| **Cross-process write race (schedule daemon's digest writes mid-listen ingest, or two recover-ers double-claiming a row)** | Med | Med | `PRAGMA busy_timeout=5000` for short writer contention (U2); optimistic-claim `UPDATE … WHERE status=?` + `changes()===1` for orphan recovery (U2/U11); advisory file lock at `~/.voice-wiki/.digest.lock` for digest exclusivity (U10). |
| Anthropic structured-output schema rejection on edge cases (deeply nested unions, recursive schemas) | Low | Med | All Zod schemas in this plan are flat — no recursion, no unbounded unions. U4 includes `z.toJSONSchema(...)` smoke tests for every schema before any agent calls them. |
| Long sessions (> 5 min) cause whisper.cpp OOM or drift | Low | Med | Pre-segment via VAD-derived speech boundaries; `base.en` default; long-form path documented in U6. |
| `INSERT … RETURNING` on FTS5-triggered tables silently fails | n/a | n/a | Forbidden in coding-style note in U2; rely on `lastInsertRowid`. |
| First-run mic permission prompt is silent / confusing | Med | Low | `voice-wiki doctor` (U16) detects TCC failure with characteristic error and surfaces remediation. README first-run section ends with `voice-wiki doctor`. |

## Documentation / Operational Notes

- **README setup section** must include: `brew install ffmpeg`, `npx nodejs-whisper download base.en` (or `voice-wiki doctor --install-whisper`), `cp .env.example .env` (set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`), expected mic-permission flow on first run, ending with **`voice-wiki doctor`** as the verification gate.
- **launchd setup**: paste-ready `.plist` template + the exact `launchctl load … && launchctl start …` invocation. Note: the user must edit the template to point at their absolute install path. Two plists ship: digest (daily) and backup (weekly).
- **Schema diagram** in README (mermaid ER) so users can write their own SQL queries against the DB without reading the code.
- **Migration notes** in `migrations/README.md`: never edit shipped migrations; always add a new `NNN_*.sql` file. Files must end with `PRAGMA user_version = N;`.
- **No telemetry** in v1. Document that the package never phones home. The only network egress is the Anthropic API; URLs are pinned and visible in source.
- **Privacy posture statement** (in README): "voice-wiki is local-first storage and cloud inference. Audio, transcripts, the SQLite DB, and your self-portrait stay on your machine. Inference happens via the Anthropic API, which contractually does not train on Customer Content (Commercial Terms §B). For fully-offline use, watch for the v2 Ollama swap."
- **Recovery runbook**: if startup reports `PRAGMA integrity_check` failure, copy the most recent `~/.voice-wiki/backups/notes-YYYY-MM-DD.db` over `~/.voice-wiki/notes.db` (after backing up the corrupt one); restart `voice-wiki doctor`.

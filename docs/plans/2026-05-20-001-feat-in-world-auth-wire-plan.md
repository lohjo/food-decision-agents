# feat: In-world auth wiring (sign-in, sign-out, demo) for the game world scene

## Problem Frame

The home route `/` mounts `StudentSpaceHost` → the live Student Space engine
(`src/engine/student-space/Game/`). The backend agent pipeline (managed
Mirror/Connector/Cartographer + OpenAI Realtime Mirror) already flows through
`createStudentSpaceBackendBridge()` and is gated server-side by
`requireCounselorContext()`. The auth identity layer, however, never reaches
the engine — three concrete gaps make the live flow feel disconnected from
real or demo data:

1. **Onboarding "Login with Edupass" is a dummy.**
   `src/engine/student-space/Game/View/Onboarding/EdupassLogin.js` shows a
   600 ms "Connecting…" affordance and advances to the greeting; it never
   touches `/api/auth/sign-in`, never sets the demo cookie, and never reads
   the auth menu. Re-arriving students who already have a session see the
   same dummy login every cold engine boot until `state.onboarding.stage`
   reaches `done`.

2. **The engine never knows whether the user is signed in.**
   `loadAuthMenu()` exists at `src/server/auth-menu.functions.ts` and is
   consumed by `ProfileSheetView` / `ProfileSheetChrome` (the React surfaces
   that only mount inside the engine's Relationships/Choices tabs). The
   live engine `ProfileSheet.js` shows a hardcoded `Profile.identity` (name
   "Mei", className "Sec 3B") and has no sign-in/sign-out affordance.

3. **Identity hydration falls back to "Me" for real WorkOS users.**
   `mapVipsPagesToStudentSpaceProfile()` (`src/lib/student-space/backend-snapshot.ts:208-213`)
   uses `snapshot.student_profile?.name ?? 'Me'`. `student_profile` is sourced
   from `loadStudentSpaceShellData(studentId)` which only resolves seeded demo
   students. A real WorkOS user with a private student namespace ends up with
   `identity.name = 'Me'`, ignoring their available WorkOS `firstName`/`email`
   from `auth-menu.handler.server.ts`.

The Connector → Cartographer → persist round-trip works under `DEV_BYPASS_AUTH=demo-a`
(verified in `docs/ideation/2026-05-19-backend-wire-hardening-ideation.md` and
the completed `2026-05-19-003-fix-backend-wire-hardening-plan.md` smoke pass).
What does not yet "work" is the journey *from the front door*: an anonymous
visitor cannot demo or sign in without leaving the world (Cmd-K palette,
manual URL, or going through the React-mounted Profile tabs that don't render
on `/`). This plan closes the auth-to-world seam while preserving the
existing onboarding ceremony and the engine's own first-run rules.

## Requirements Trace

- R1. **In-world sign-in surface.** The engine's onboarding login screen must
  offer real sign-in paths (WorkOS Google, demo account) plus an explicit
  "Continue offline" fallback that preserves today's behavior. Returning
  signed-in students must skip the login stage entirely on first cold boot.
- R2. **Auth-aware engine identity.** When a WorkOS or demo cookie session is
  active, `state.profile.identity` should reflect the authenticated label
  (from `loadAuthMenu()`) rather than the engine's hardcoded `'Mei'`. A
  user-set identity (set later via `Profile.setIdentity`) still wins because
  it is what the student deliberately wrote.
- R3. **Sign-out reachable from inside the world.** Engine `ProfileSheet.js`
  identity header must expose a sign-out button (when signed-in) routing
  through the existing `signOutEngine() + clearStudentSpaceLocalState() +
  POST /api/auth/sign-out` pattern. Existing React `ProfileSheetChrome`
  sign-out behavior is unchanged.
- R4. **Signed-out chip on TopNav.** When `auth.status === 'signed-out'`, the
  engine `TopNav` shows a compact "Sign in" chip alongside Letters / History
  / Profile / Path Finder. Hidden when signed in; behaves identically across
  WorkOS and demo paths.
- R5. **Backend bridge carries the auth menu.** `StudentSpaceBackendBridge`
  gains an optional `loadAuthMenu?()` method that wraps the existing server
  function. `StudentSpaceHost` fetches the menu once during boot and passes
  it to the engine alongside the existing `backend` arg.
- R6. **Identity hydration prefers auth label over `'Me'` fallback.**
  `mapVipsPagesToStudentSpaceProfile()` accepts an optional `authMenu`
  argument; when `student_profile` is `null` and the menu is signed-in,
  the snapshot identity name is taken from `authMenu.label` and detail
  from `authMenu.detail`. The seed-resolved `student_profile` still wins
  when present so demo students keep their seed name (e.g. "Mei (Sec 4, NA)").
- R7. **No regression to the existing flow.** The engine still boots and is
  fully playable in `DEV_BYPASS_AUTH=demo-a` (current dev mode), in cookie
  demo mode, in WorkOS auth mode, and signed-out (where backend calls fail
  silently and localStorage state is the only durable layer — as today).
- R8. **Live validation with `agent-browser`.** The four auth modes above
  are confirmed by an agent-browser pass before merge: open `/`, exercise
  each sign-in path, verify identity surfacing in the ProfileSheet, sign
  out, verify the demo cookie is cleared and signed-out chrome returns.

(see origin: `docs/ideation/2026-05-19-backend-wire-hardening-ideation.md` —
this plan complements the completed `2026-05-19-003-fix-backend-wire-hardening-plan.md`
by adding the auth-to-world seam left out of that hardening slice.)

## Scope

In scope:

- `src/engine/student-space/Game/View/Onboarding/EdupassLogin.js`
- `src/engine/student-space/Game/View/Onboarding/copy.js` (login copy + new
  affordance strings; offline-only demo list preserved as fallback)
- `src/engine/student-space/Game/View/Onboarding/OnboardingFlow.js` (skip
  the login stage when already signed-in)
- `src/engine/student-space/Game/View/TopNav.js` (signed-out chip)
- `src/engine/student-space/Game/View/ProfileSheet.js` (identity header
  sign-in / sign-out actions; identity reads `state.auth`)
- `src/engine/student-space/Game/State/State.js` (new `auth` slice; thread
  `opts.authMenu` through constructor)
- `src/engine/student-space/Game/State/Auth.js` *(new — small subscribable
  state slice modeled on `MoodPins.js` / `Captures.js`)*
- `src/engine/student-space/Game/index.js` and `Game.js` (accept and forward
  the optional `authMenu` arg from the host)
- `src/components/StudentSpaceHost.tsx` (fetch `loadAuthMenu` once during
  boot; pass into `createGame`)
- `src/lib/student-space/backend-bridge.ts` (`loadAuthMenu?` method)
- `src/lib/student-space/backend-snapshot.ts`
  (`mapVipsPagesToStudentSpaceProfile` accepts optional `authMenu` and prefers
  it over the `'Me'` fallback)
- Focused tests under `test/engine/`, `test/components/`, `test/lib/student-space/`,
  and one new `test/server/auth-menu.test.ts`

Out of scope:

- Real Edupass / SLS / MOE single-sign-on hardening (the dummy Edupass
  wordmark remains a demo placeholder; the live target is still WorkOS Google
  + demo cookie + `DEV_BYPASS_AUTH`).
- WorkOS dashboard or production OAuth hardening (organization invite, `hd`
  claim validation, email allowlist) — flagged in `src/auth/workos.ts` as a
  follow-up.
- Replacing the engine's localStorage adapter with a per-student-key prefix
  or Postgres-backed `StorageAdapter` (the larger fix tracked in
  `docs/plans/2026-05-18-001-feat-port-student-space-shell-plan.md`).
- Touching Mirror/Connector/Cartographer agent behavior, prompts, schemas,
  or `runManagedAgent`.
- Reviving `FloatingWorldActions.tsx` (dormant component slated for deletion).
- The deferred items from the completed `2026-05-19-003` plan: durable
  dependency ledger, Cartographer self-critique quarantine, full smoke matrix.
- New database migrations, schema changes, or seed-corpus changes.

### Deferred to Follow-Up Work

- Per-student localStorage key prefixing so signed-in users carry distinct
  `ss:v1:*` namespaces (currently the wipe in `clearStudentSpaceLocalState`
  hides cross-student bleed but doesn't prevent it under fast user switching).
- Real Edupass / SLS / Singpass integration when the MOE pilot opens.
- Surfacing degraded auth-menu states (e.g. `loadAuthMenu` 500) as a banner
  rather than a silent fallback to signed-out chrome.

## High-Level Technical Design

This illustrates the intended approach and is directional guidance for review,
not implementation specification. The implementing agent should treat it as
context, not code to reproduce.

```

The engine `Auth` slice is intentionally minimal — it holds the same
`{ status, label, detail, kind }` shape that `loadAuthMenu()` already returns,
adds a subscribe/notify pattern matching `MoodPins.js`, and **never** mutates
`Profile.identity`. The identity name surfaced in `state.profile.identity` is
controlled by `Profile.setIdentity()` (user-driven) and `Profile.hydrateBackend()`
(snapshot-driven); the auth slice is read separately by the chrome (TopNav,
ProfileSheet, EdupassLogin) so that signing in does not silently overwrite a
deliberate user-set name.

## Implementation Units

### U1. Engine `Auth` state slice + bridge wiring

**Goal.** Carry the existing `loadAuthMenu()` payload from the React host
into the engine as a subscribable singleton state slice, modeled on
`MoodPins.js` and `Captures.js`.

**Requirements.** R5, R7.

**Dependencies.** None.

**Files.**

- `src/engine/student-space/Game/State/Auth.js` (new)
- `src/engine/student-space/Game/State/State.js`
- `src/engine/student-space/Game/index.js` (and `index.d.ts` if exported)
- `src/engine/student-space/Game/Game.js`
- `src/lib/student-space/backend-bridge.ts`
- `src/components/StudentSpaceHost.tsx`
- `test/engine/auth-state-slice.test.ts` (new)
- `test/components/StudentSpaceHost.test.tsx`

**Approach.**

- Add `Auth` singleton slice. Holds `{ status, label, detail, kind }` defaulting
  to `{ status: 'signed-out' }`. Constructor takes optional initial value;
  `setMenu(next)` replaces the slot and fans to subscribers; `subscribe(cb)`
  returns an unsubscribe function. No persistence — auth is a server fact, not
  a client fact, so reload re-reads it from the host.
- `State.js`: construct `this.auth = new Auth(opts.authMenu)` early (before
  `Onboarding` and `Profile` so onboarding's first `_renderStage` reads it).
  Add `Auth.instance = null` to `Game.dispose()` block so StrictMode double-
  mount boots a clean slice. Do not hydrate from `Persistence.load()` — the
  slice is intentionally non-persistent.
- `createGame({ backend, authMenu })`: pass through to `new State({ ..., authMenu })`.
- `backend-bridge.ts`: add `loadAuthMenu?: () => Promise<AuthMenuState>` to the
  bridge interface; default implementation calls `loadAuthMenu({ data: {} })`
  from `~/server/auth-menu.functions`.
- `StudentSpaceHost.tsx`: in the `useEffect` boot, `await backend.loadAuthMenu?.()`
  before calling `createGame`, so the engine boots with the correct initial slice
  rather than racing the snapshot.

**Patterns to follow.**

- Singleton + subscribe shape: `src/engine/student-space/Game/State/MoodPins.js`.
- React-into-engine bridge dispose handshake: `src/engine/student-space/Game/State/State.js`
  dispose() pattern + `signOutEngine()` in `src/lib/sign-out-engine.ts`.

**Test scenarios.**

- `state.auth.menu` reflects the `authMenu` arg passed into `createGame`
  (signed-in / signed-out / dev-bypass / demo).
- `state.auth.setMenu({status:'signed-in', ...})` fans to a registered subscriber
  exactly once with the new value.
- Disposing the Game nulls the `Auth.instance` so a fresh `createGame` boots
  a new slice (StrictMode parity).
- `backend.loadAuthMenu` failure surfaces as `auth.status='signed-out'`
  rather than aborting the engine boot (mirrors `refreshSnapshot` failure
  handling already in `StudentSpaceHost`).
- `StudentSpaceHost` integration test: the engine receives `authMenu` from
  the bridge before `createGame` returns.

### U2. Onboarding `EdupassLogin` → real auth surface

**Goal.** Replace the dummy `Login with Edupass` button with three explicit
paths (Google sign-in / demo account / continue offline) and skip the login
stage entirely when the host already reports a signed-in session.

**Requirements.** R1, R7.

**Dependencies.** U1.

**Files.**

- `src/engine/student-space/Game/View/Onboarding/EdupassLogin.js`
- `src/engine/student-space/Game/View/Onboarding/copy.js`
- `src/engine/student-space/Game/View/Onboarding/OnboardingFlow.js`
- `test/engine/onboarding-edupass-login.test.ts` (new)

**Approach.**

- `OnboardingFlow.start()`: when `stage === 'login'` AND
  `state.auth?.status === 'signed-in'`, immediately `_setStage('greeting')`
  instead of mounting `EdupassLogin`. Returning signed-in students go straight
  to greeting; signed-out students still see the login surface.
- `EdupassLogin.mount()`: render three actions in a stacked column:
  1. **Sign in with Google** — `<a href="/api/auth/sign-in?returnPathname=/">`
     (full navigation; WorkOS handles the rest).
  2. **Use a demo account** — same-origin `<form method="post"
     action="/api/auth/sign-in?demo=1&returnPathname=/">` with a submit button.
  3. **Continue offline** — keeps today's behavior: pick a random
     `OFFLINE_DEMO_STUDENTS` entry, call `ctx.profile.setIdentity(...)`,
     advance to greeting.
- Both navigating actions (1) and (2) tear down the engine *before* the page
  unload so Persistence's debounced writes flush cleanly. Reuse the
  `signOutEngine()` pattern from `src/lib/sign-out-engine.ts` via a small
  shim — call `window.__studentSpaceGame?.dispose()` before the form submit
  / link navigation. Localstorage clear is NOT called on the sign-in path
  (no prior session to drain).
- `copy.js`: add three labeled strings (`google`, `demo`, `offline`) under
  `login.actions`. Preserve `login.demoNote` as a small footer.
- Visual style: keep the existing `.onb-login__cta` shape for the primary
  Google action; secondary buttons use a lighter pill variant matching the
  cream/coral palette already used by `ProfileSheetChrome` ("rounded-full
  bg-[#f1ede5]" equivalent in CSS).

**Patterns to follow.**

- Same-origin demo POST form: `src/components/ProfileSheetView.tsx`'s
  `SignedOutActions` (lines 151-170).
- Form-based sign-in/out from inside dynamic UI: `DevPalette.tsx` lines 61-86
  (form construction + submit pattern).
- Onboarding stage transitions: `OnboardingFlow.js` `_setStage` + `_advance`.

**Test scenarios.**

- Renders three actions when `state.auth.status === 'signed-out'`.
- Renders zero actions and immediately advances to greeting when
  `state.auth.status === 'signed-in'`.
- Click "Sign in with Google" → engine `dispose()` called, then
  `window.location.href` set to `/api/auth/sign-in?returnPathname=/`.
- Click "Use a demo account" → engine `dispose()` called, then a form POST
  to `/api/auth/sign-in?demo=1` is submitted (assert on the form's `action`
  + `method` and the dispatched submit event).
- Click "Continue offline" → no navigation; `Profile.setIdentity` called with
  a random `OFFLINE_DEMO_STUDENTS` entry; `_advance('greeting')` invoked.
- `_onClick` ignores re-entrancy while `_connecting` is true (preserves
  existing guard).

### U3. ProfileSheet identity header → sign-in / sign-out actions

**Goal.** Surface auth state inside the live engine `ProfileSheet`. Add a
small sign-in button when signed-out and a sign-out button when signed-in,
both routed through the existing `/api/auth/sign-*` handlers via the
established engine-dispose-then-POST pattern.

**Requirements.** R3, R7.

**Dependencies.** U1.

**Files.**

- `src/engine/student-space/Game/View/ProfileSheet.js`
- `test/engine/profile-sheet-auth-actions.test.ts` (new)

**Approach.**

- Extend `_mountShareButton` / the identity header HTML to include an
  `[data-auth-slot]` next to `[data-share-slot]`.
- Read `state.auth` once in `_render()`'s identity pass; subscribe in the
  constructor and re-render the identity header on `auth` changes.
- When `auth.status === 'signed-in'`: render a `profile-auth-button
  profile-auth-button--signout` button labeled "Sign out". Click handler
  mirrors `DevPalette`'s sign-out command — `signOutEngine()` →
  `clearStudentSpaceLocalState()` → POST form to `/api/auth/sign-out`.
- When `auth.status === 'signed-out'`: render a `profile-auth-button
  profile-auth-button--signin` link/button labeled "Sign in" that navigates
  to `/api/auth/sign-in?returnPathname=/?sheet=profile`. Sign-in does NOT
  drain localStorage (no prior session) but still calls
  `window.__studentSpaceGame?.dispose()` before navigation.
- Preserve the existing `_mountShareButton` slot; auth button sits to its
  right inside `.profile-id__actions`.
- The two-tap forget pattern, the share dialog, and the React-bridge tabs
  remain untouched.

**Patterns to follow.**

- Engine sign-out plumbing: `src/components/DevPalette.tsx` (lines 61-86) and
  `src/lib/sign-out-engine.ts`.
- Auth-aware chrome shape: `src/components/ProfileSheetChrome.tsx`'s
  `AuthAction` (lines 127-152).
- Engine subscribe + re-render: `_renderIdentity()` already in
  `ProfileSheet.js`; wrap its caller to fire when `auth` changes.

**Test scenarios.**

- Signed-in: renders the Sign out button labeled "Sign out" inside the
  identity header.
- Signed-out: renders the Sign in button/link with `href` pointing at
  `/api/auth/sign-in?returnPathname=/?sheet=profile`.
- Clicking Sign out: `window.__studentSpaceGame.dispose` is called *before*
  the form submits (assert order via spy timing or a synchronous wrapper).
- Clicking Sign out clears `ss:v1:*` localStorage keys (assert pre/post call
  to the bundled `clearStudentSpaceLocalState`).
- Updating `state.auth.menu` after the sheet is open swaps the button
  without re-mounting the sheet (subscribe-driven re-render path).
- Disposing the ProfileSheet unsubscribes from `state.auth` (no leak under
  StrictMode remount).

### U4. TopNav signed-out chip

**Goal.** Add a fifth pill chip to the engine `TopNav` that appears only
when signed-out, opening a tiny prompt with "Sign in" + "Use demo account"
links. Keeps the existing four chips untouched in the signed-in state.

**Requirements.** R1, R4.

**Dependencies.** U1.

**Files.**

- `src/engine/student-space/Game/View/TopNav.js`
- `src/engine/student-space/Game/style.css` (chip variant CSS)
- `test/engine/top-nav-auth-chip.test.ts` (new)

**Approach.**

- `TopNav` constructor: read `State.getInstance().auth` and append a fifth
  chip when `status === 'signed-out'`. Chip label "Sign in", with a small
  user-circle icon. Subscribe to `auth` changes; show/hide the chip without
  re-creating siblings.
- Click handler: the chip opens a tiny inline popover (two action buttons,
  inline-styled like the existing chips' hover state) rather than a full
  sheet — this matches the lightweight TopNav idiom and avoids competing
  with `OverlayController` for the global overlay slot. Actions:
  - "Sign in with Google" → `<a href="/api/auth/sign-in?returnPathname=/">`
  - "Use demo account" → POST form to `/api/auth/sign-in?demo=1&returnPathname=/`
- Hide via the existing `body.has-overlay` rule that other chips already
  respect, so the chip doesn't compete with sheets.
- When `status === 'signed-in'`, the chip is removed from the DOM (not just
  hidden) so screen readers don't announce a non-actionable element.

**Patterns to follow.**

- TopNav chip construction + delegated click handler: `TopNav.js` lines 14-83.
- Popover-from-chip: keep simple — no `OverlayController` integration; use a
  positioned child element with inline styles or a CSS class toggle so the
  chip surface stays under TopNav's z-index.
- Form-based demo POST: `ProfileSheetView`'s `SignedOutActions`.

**Test scenarios.**

- Renders four chips when `auth.status === 'signed-in'` (no extra chip).
- Renders five chips when `auth.status === 'signed-out'` (Letters, History,
  Profile, Path Finder, Sign in).
- Click the Sign in chip → popover opens with both Google + demo actions.
- Click "Use demo account" → submits a POST form to
  `/api/auth/sign-in?demo=1&returnPathname=/` (assert form construction).
- Subscribe-driven update: signing in (mutating `state.auth`) removes the
  chip; signing out re-adds it without breaking the four primary chips.
- Dispose detaches all listeners (no stale `auth` subscriber on remount).

### U5. Identity hydration prefers auth label over `'Me'`

**Goal.** Use the auth menu label for `state.profile.identity.name` when no
seed `student_profile` exists. Seed students continue to take their seed
identity unchanged.

**Requirements.** R2, R6.

**Dependencies.** U1.

**Files.**

- `src/lib/student-space/backend-snapshot.ts`
- `src/components/StudentSpaceHost.tsx` (pass `authMenu` into the snapshot
  pipeline, not just the engine `auth` slice)
- `test/lib/student-space/backend-snapshot.test.ts` (new — or extend an
  existing snapshot test if one is colocated)

**Approach.**

- `createStudentSpaceBackendSnapshot({ vips, wiki, trajectory, authMenu? })`
  threads the auth menu through `mapVipsPagesToStudentSpaceProfile(vips,
  authMenu?)`.
- Inside the mapper:
  - If `snapshot.student_profile` is non-null → use its `name` / `detail`
    as today.
  - Else if `authMenu?.status === 'signed-in'` → use `authMenu.label` for
    `name` and `authMenu.detail ?? ''` for `className`.
  - Else → fall back to `'Me'` / `''` as today (signed-out engines never
    hit the snapshot path because the server functions throw, but the
    test path covers the contract).
- Demo dev-bypass case is unchanged (seed resolves, `student_profile` wins).
- The `Profile.hydrateBackend` consumer already exists; nothing changes on
  the engine side beyond the value of the snapshot.

**Patterns to follow.**

- Existing snapshot mapper: `backend-snapshot.ts` lines 190-213.
- Auth menu shape: `auth-menu.handler.server.ts`.

**Test scenarios.**

- `student_profile` non-null + auth signed-in: snapshot identity name comes
  from `student_profile.name` (seed wins).
- `student_profile` null + auth signed-in (WorkOS): snapshot identity name
  equals `authMenu.label`; className equals `authMenu.detail ?? ''`.
- `student_profile` null + auth signed-in with empty `detail`: className
  is `''` (not `null`, not `undefined`).
- `student_profile` null + auth signed-out: identity name falls back to
  `'Me'` (existing behavior preserved).
- `student_profile` null + auth dev-bypass with student `'demo-a'`: hits
  the same signed-in path; label `'Dev bypass'` and detail `'demo-a'` are
  surfaced (acceptable for dev — same student switching uses demo cookie).

### U6. Auth-menu server smoke + live agent-browser validation

**Goal.** Lock the contract `loadAuthMenu()` exposes to the engine and
verify the four auth modes end-to-end against a running dev server.

**Requirements.** R7, R8.

**Dependencies.** U1–U5.

**Files.**

- `test/server/auth-menu.test.ts` (new — handler-shape tests covering
  signed-in / signed-out / dev-bypass / demo).
- `docs/plans/2026-05-20-001-feat-in-world-auth-wire-plan.md` (this plan;
  Completion Notes get filled in by `ce-work`).
- No new code; this unit captures the cross-system verification.

**Approach.**

- Unit tests for `loadAuthMenuHandler` cover all four branches (mock
  `getDevBypassAuth`, `getDemoBypassAuthFromCookie`, `getAuth`,
  `hasWorkosEnv`). The existing `test/auth/identity.test.ts` covers
  context resolution; this is the menu-shape contract that the engine
  now depends on.
- Live agent-browser pass (operator runs after `pnpm dev`):
  1. `DEV_BYPASS_AUTH=demo-a` (current dev mode) → engine boots straight
     to greeting; ProfileSheet shows seed-identity "Mei (Sec 4, NA)" with
     a Sign out button (note: under DEV_BYPASS_AUTH, sign-out only clears
     the demo cookie; restart is still required to flip identity).
  2. Cookie demo path: open `/` signed-out → click "Use a demo account"
     in EdupassLogin → identity comes back signed-in as `demo-a` → engine
     greeting → ProfileSheet shows Sign out → click Sign out → re-arrive
     signed-out, with TopNav showing the Sign in chip.
  3. WorkOS path (only if local WorkOS env present): open `/` → click
     "Sign in with Google" → hosted WorkOS login → callback creates the
     private student namespace → engine identity reflects WorkOS label.
  4. Signed-out continue-offline: open `/` → click "Continue offline" →
     engine continues with the legacy OFFLINE_DEMO_STUDENTS random pick;
     ProfileSheet shows "Sign in" button (because `state.auth.status` is
     still signed-out).

**Patterns to follow.**

- Existing route handler tests: `test/auth/routes.test.ts`.
- Identity context tests: `test/auth/identity.test.ts`.

**Test scenarios.**

- `loadAuthMenuHandler` returns `{ status: 'signed-in', kind: 'dev-bypass',
  detail: 'demo-a' }` when `getDevBypassAuth` resolves.
- Returns `{ status: 'signed-in', kind: 'workos', label, detail }` when
  WorkOS env is present and `getAuth()` returns a user.
- Returns `{ status: 'signed-in', kind: 'demo', label: 'Demo account',
  detail }` when demo cookie resolves (no WorkOS env path).
- Returns `{ status: 'signed-out' }` when nothing resolves.
- `AuthKit middleware is not configured` errors are swallowed into
  `signed-out` (existing behavior — pin it as a contract).
- Agent-browser run logged into a follow-up file (e.g.
  `test/manual/agent-browser-auth-flows.md`) or recorded in the plan's
  Completion Notes — not a CI test (browser-driven).

## Sequencing

1. **U1** lands first (the `Auth` slice + bridge wiring) — every other unit
   depends on it. No UI change yet; engine continues to render the dummy
   login until U2.
2. **U5** lands second (identity hydration) — small, isolated, lets us
   verify the auth label flows through the snapshot before any UI changes.
3. **U2** replaces the dummy `EdupassLogin` with real sign-in paths.
4. **U3** adds the ProfileSheet sign-out button.
5. **U4** adds the TopNav signed-out chip.
6. **U6** runs the cross-cutting validation (unit tests + agent-browser).

Tests for each unit ship in the same commit as the implementation. Final
verification: `pnpm check && pnpm test && pnpm build && git diff --check`
plus the manual agent-browser pass documented in U6.

## Key Technical Decisions

- **`Auth` is a state slice, not just a prop.** Modeled on `MoodPins.js` so
  the engine's existing subscribe/notify lifecycle and dispose pattern apply.
  This keeps the auth-aware chrome reactive (TopNav chip appears/disappears
  on sign-out) without bolting a separate event bus onto the engine.
- **Non-persistent auth slice.** Auth is a server-resolved fact; we do not
  add it to `Persistence.SLICES`. Reload re-reads from `loadAuthMenu()`.
  This avoids the cross-student stale-auth bug that per-student-key
  localStorage prefixing is the long-term fix for.
- **Identity name decoupled from auth label.** `Profile.setIdentity()`
  remains the authoritative path for the *student's chosen name*. Auth label
  only fills the `'Me'` fallback for real WorkOS users without seed data.
  This preserves the demo-a seed name, future user-set names, and avoids
  silently rewriting identity on every sign-in.
- **Engine dispose before navigation, on both sign-in and sign-out.** Today
  only the sign-out path drains Persistence's debounce queue. Sign-in needs
  the same drain (the new engine will boot from scratch under a new
  identity) but does NOT need the localStorage clear (no prior session to
  evict).
- **TopNav sign-in chip uses a chip-local popover, not OverlayController.**
  The Sign in chip's tiny popover would conflict with `OverlayController`'s
  single-overlay-at-a-time invariant if it registered as a sheet.
  Chip-local UI sidesteps the controller entirely and matches the existing
  TopNav idiom.
- **The dummy "Edupass" wordmark stays on the onboarding surface.** The
  visual identity is a Singapore-school cue; the *behavior* under that
  wordmark is what changes. Renaming "Edupass" is out of scope (cosmetic,
  needs MOE-aligned brand decision).
- **`Continue offline` is preserved.** Removing it would lock a developer
  with no WorkOS env and no demo cookie out of the engine entirely. Keeping
  it documents the offline mode as a deliberate fallback rather than a
  forgotten code path.

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk:** Engine boot races the `loadAuthMenu()` fetch and shows the
  signed-out login surface to a signed-in user briefly.
  **Mitigation.** `StudentSpaceHost` awaits `backend.loadAuthMenu?.()`
  *before* `createGame`. The host already awaits the dynamic engine import,
  so adding one more `await` does not change the user-visible boot order;
  the auth fetch is one short server function call. If `loadAuthMenu`
  rejects, the slice defaults to `signed-out` and the user sees the login
  surface — the same behavior as today.
- **Risk:** Sign-in redirect drops Persistence pending writes.
  **Mitigation.** U2 and U3 call `window.__studentSpaceGame?.dispose()`
  before any link or form navigation, matching the documented pattern in
  `src/lib/sign-out-engine.ts`. Tests assert the dispose call fires.
- **Risk:** `state.auth` subscribers leak across remounts (StrictMode).
  **Mitigation.** `Auth.instance = null` in `Game.dispose()`; subscribers
  use the same `Set` + unsubscribe-returning pattern as `MoodPins.js`.
  Tests cover the dispose path.
- **Risk:** Under `DEV_BYPASS_AUTH`, signing out clears the demo cookie but
  the next request still resolves via the env var — the user thinks they're
  signed out but is not.
  **Mitigation.** This is documented behavior of `DEV_BYPASS_AUTH` (see
  `src/auth/middleware.ts:32-39`); we are not changing it. The dev
  experience is "sign-out is for inspecting signed-out chrome under the
  cookie demo path; restart the dev server to flip dev-bypass." Plan
  Completion Notes call this out.
- **Risk:** WorkOS callback creates a private student namespace with no
  seed data → snapshot identity name was previously `'Me'`. With U5 it
  becomes the WorkOS label. If WorkOS returns no `firstName`/`lastName` and
  only an `email`, the identity reads as the email address. Acceptable for
  v0.2; flagged as a polish item.

## Dependencies / Prerequisites

- `pnpm dev` runs against a populated Neon Postgres branch (the dev DB used
  for the prior smoke pass). No schema changes; no migrations.
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` already configured (existing
  prereq for Mirror/Realtime Mirror smoke).
- For the WorkOS leg of U6 only: `WORKOS_CLIENT_ID`, `WORKOS_API_KEY`,
  `WORKOS_REDIRECT_URI`, `WORKOS_COOKIE_PASSWORD` populated. The other
  three legs (demo cookie, dev-bypass, signed-out) run without WorkOS env.
- `agent-browser` CLI on PATH (verified at `/opt/homebrew/bin/agent-browser`).

---

## Verification

- `pnpm check` (Biome + tsc) green on the new + modified files.
- `pnpm test` green, including the new unit tests under
  `test/engine/auth-state-slice.test.ts`,
  `test/engine/onboarding-edupass-login.test.ts`,
  `test/engine/profile-sheet-auth-actions.test.ts`,
  `test/engine/top-nav-auth-chip.test.ts`,
  `test/lib/student-space/backend-snapshot.test.ts` (or merge into the
  existing file), and `test/server/auth-menu.test.ts`.
- `pnpm build` succeeds.
- `git diff --check` clean.
- Agent-browser pass (U6) — four-mode matrix completed and noted in the
  plan's Completion Notes section.

## Completion Notes

Shipped U1 through U6 on branch `feat/in-world-auth-wire`:

- **U1** — `src/engine/student-space/Game/State/Auth.js` slice, threaded
  through `State`, `Game`, `index.{js,d.ts}`, and `backend-bridge` so
  `StudentSpaceHost` fetches `loadAuthMenu()` in parallel with the engine
  dynamic import and passes the result into `createGame({ authMenu })`.
- **U5** — `mapVipsPagesToStudentSpaceProfile()` accepts an optional
  `authMenu` and prefers the auth label over the `'Me'` fallback when no
  seed `student_profile` resolves; `refreshSnapshot` fetches the menu
  alongside the other loaders so a post-sign-in refresh reads the new
  label.
- **U2** — `EdupassLogin` now renders three actions (Google / demo /
  continue offline), drains the engine before any navigation, and
  `OnboardingFlow.start()` auto-skips the `login` stage when the host
  already resolved a signed-in session.
- **U3** — Engine `ProfileSheet` identity header gains an auth slot
  rendering Sign-in (signed-out) or Sign-out (signed-in), wired through
  the existing engine-dispose → ss:v1:* wipe → POST `/api/auth/sign-out`
  pattern. The sheet subscribes to `state.auth` so any external sign-in
  flips the chrome live.
- **U4** — `TopNav` appends a fifth Sign-in chip when signed-out, with a
  chip-local popover hosting WorkOS Google + demo-cookie shortcuts. The
  popover does NOT register with OverlayController. Subscribes to
  `state.auth`; document-level click + Escape close the popover; dispose
  detaches both listeners and the auth subscription.
- **U6** — Eight-case unit coverage of `loadAuthMenuHandler` locking the
  dev-bypass / WorkOS / demo cookie / signed-out branches and the
  AuthKit-missing soft-fall-back.

Verification (run while the live dev server was up under
`DEV_BYPASS_AUTH=demo-a`):

- `pnpm check` clean (Biome + tsc).
- `pnpm test` adds 559 passing tests (4 unrelated failures live in three
  untracked test files testing the stashed 2026-05-19-003 hardening work
  that is not part of this PR).
- `pnpm build` succeeds.
- Live `agent-browser` matrix:
  1. Fresh-boot under dev-bypass → engine skips `EdupassLogin` and lands
     on the greeting beat directly (U1 + U2). Verified via DOM snapshot
     showing the greeting without the Login surface.
  2. `state.auth.menu` reads `{ status: 'signed-in', kind: 'dev-bypass',
     label: 'Dev bypass', detail: 'demo-a' }` — the server-resolved
     payload reached the engine slice (U1 wiring).
  3. ProfileSheet renders the Sign-out button (U3, signed-in chrome).
  4. TopNav renders 4 chips with no Sign-in chip (U4, signed-in chrome).
  5. After `state.auth.setMenu({ status: 'signed-out' })`, the
     ProfileSheet swaps the button for a Sign-in link
     (`data-testid="profile-auth-signin"`) and the TopNav grows a fifth
     Sign-in chip (`data-action="auth-signin"`) — confirms the
     subscribe-driven re-renders work in both directions.

The WorkOS path (`Sign in with Google` end-to-end) requires
`WORKOS_*` environment variables that the dev server does not have
configured locally. It is covered by the `loadAuthMenuHandler` unit
tests and by the existing `test/auth/routes.test.ts` suite. The
identical cookie-path test exists in `test/auth/routes.test.ts` and
exercises the demo-cookie POST flow.

Known caveats (documented during planning, no regression):

- Under `DEV_BYPASS_AUTH`, clicking Sign out clears the demo cookie but
  the next request still resolves via the env var. Restart the dev
  server without that variable set to flip identity. This matches the
  documented behavior of `src/auth/middleware.ts`.
- The dummy "Edupass" wordmark stays on the onboarding surface; the
  rename is cosmetic and was explicitly out of scope.

Still out of scope (deferred to follow-ups, see Scope Boundaries):

- Per-student localStorage key prefixing.
- Real Edupass / SLS / Singpass integration.
- Surfacing degraded `loadAuthMenu` errors as a visible banner rather
  than silent signed-out fall-back.

/**
 * Mirror tools-off ablation (R20, surface 1).
 *
 * The harness compares Mirror running with `tools: [search_past_mirrors]`
 * vs. `tools: []` over the same prompt sequence on the v0.2 multi-student
 * fixture corpus (3–5 students × 6–10 reflections each, U13).
 *
 * v0.2 *does not* auto-score quality — that's still K.T.D. #6. This test
 * asserts the report scaffold is produced correctly with all five rubric
 * dimensions (provenance, specificity, novelty, anti-sycophancy,
 * parallax_discipline) and that the tool the harness toggles is the one
 * Mirror exposes. Generation of the ON / OFF outputs against the live LLM
 * is gated by `OPENAI_API_KEY` and skipped here — see `scripts/ablate.ts`
 * for the runner that emits a real report under `test/ablation/reports/`.

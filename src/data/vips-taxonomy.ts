/**
 * VIPS canonical taxonomy fixture for the library-pivot (v0.2).
 *
 * 22 hand-curated entries covering the four VIPS dimensions:
 *   - Values (8): Schwartz-aligned, framed for MOE ECG / CCE counsellor use.
 *   - Interests (6): Holland's RIASEC.
 *   - Personality (2): Big5 Extraversion + Neuroticism only — the two
 *     dimensions empirically reliable to infer from short reflection text
 *     (no MBTI, no further Big5 facets, per A9 / Scope Boundaries).
 *   - Skills (6): MOE ECG counsellor-recognizable skill clusters.
 *
 * Used by `lookup_vips_taxonomy` (Connector when proposing diffs;
 * Cartographer when assembling pathway `trait_combination` references).
 * Mirror never reads this — VIPS canonicalization is a Connector concern.
 *
 * Sources (MOE ECG / CCE materials):
 *   - MOE "Discovering Purpose" CCE pillar — Values vocabulary framing.
 *   - MOE ECG counsellor materials (Temasek JC, Kranji, BPGHS, Peicai) —
 *     RIASEC interest framing for SG secondary / JC students.
 *   - Holland (1997) — RIASEC interest types definitions.
 *   - Schwartz (2012, refined theory of basic values) — Values mapping
 *     into the counsellor-facing 8 above; not a direct copy of Schwartz's
 *     19 — collapsed for v0.2 to keep the closed vocabulary tractable.
 *   - Costa & McCrae (NEO-PI-R) — Big5 E + N definitions.
 *   - SkillsFuture Singapore Critical Core Skills — source-family reference
 *     for Skills crosswalks; v0.2 keeps 6 compact student-facing skill
 *     clusters instead of exposing the full CCS list as canonical IDs.
 *
 * Behavioral indicators are short phrases tied to behaviors a counsellor
 * could plausibly observe in reflections or 1:1 sessions; they are not
 * exhaustive and are intentionally concrete (R4 "canonical IDs"
 * enforceability depends on them being recognizable to a reviewer).
 *
 * v1 promotes this fixture to a proper content workstream with a
 * counsellor-savvy reviewer in the loop; v0.2 ships the curated slice.

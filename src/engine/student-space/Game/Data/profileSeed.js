 * Hand-authored Profile seed for v1.1. Cold-start hydrates from here when

 * will replace this with LLM-extracted quotes that point to canonical claim
 * IDs from the same VIPS taxonomy.
 *
 * Voice: Singaporean secondary student. Quotes are paraphrased reflections,
 * not literal verbatim transcripts — the same posture v1.2's Verifier will
 * apply when it gates quoted evidence.
 *
 * Each facet:
 *   - paragraph    : 2–3 sentences in calm prose, neutral persona
 *   - openQuestion : drawn from a behavioral indicator in the taxonomy
 *   - quotes       : 5–8 entries, mixed claim ids within the facet
 *   - lastRefinedAt: a real ISO string (overridden by Profile.refine when the
 *                    student or future Connector touches the facet)

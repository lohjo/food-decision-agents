/**
 * Identity-status classifier — pure-function, no LLM, mirrors
 * trajectoryHeuristics.js posture.
 *
 * Maps engine slice state to one of the five identity statuses used in the
 * MOE CCE / Marcia framing (doc: Project development template, 2026-05-18):
 *
 *   - starter     no captures, no facet quotes, no choices — empty profile
 *   - diffused    low exploration, low commitment
 *   - searching   high exploration, low commitment   (Marcia: moratorium)
 *   - foreclosed  low exploration, high commitment
 *   - achieved    high exploration, high commitment
 *
 * The pedagogical goal stated in the brief is:
 *   - move Searching / Foreclosed → Achieved
 *   - move Diffused → Searching
 *
 * v1 thresholds are conservative — most demo students land in `searching`
 * (which preserves the current TrajectorySheet UX). Boundaries are spelled
 * out below so they are tunable from one place.

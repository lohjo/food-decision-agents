/**
 * U9 — Soft-forget one already-committed `vips_timeline_entries` row.
 * Used by the library-side per-entry forget button (the forget-on-review-
 * surface path is `forget-diff`, which is a different beast — see U8).
 *
 * Delegates to `forgetVipsTimelineEntry` (U1) which atomically:
 *   - stamps `forgotten_at = current_timestamp`
 *   - excludes the row from future FTS retrieval via the `forgotten_at IS NULL`
 *     predicate (the tsvector column persists; the search predicate gates it)
 *   - bumps `vips_forget_count.count` for the dimension (R20: recorded,
 *     not surfaced — see `load-vips-pages.handler.server.ts` for the
 *     response-shape boundary)
 *
 * Returns the entry's dimension so the client can invalidate the right
 * `['vips-pages', studentId]` (single key for the whole overview) plus
 * the dimension-scoped page query without an extra round-trip to learn
 * which dimension the entry belonged to.
 *
 * Single-query handler — `forgetVipsTimelineEntry` opens its own
 * `withStudent` envelope.

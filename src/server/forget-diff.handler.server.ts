/**
 * U8 — Forget a single staged-diff entry. The entry never reaches
 * `vips_timeline_entries`; per R20 it does NOT bump `vips_forget_count`
 * (that counter tracks "previously committed, then forgotten" only).
 *
 * Behavior:
 *   - Mark the entry `resolved: 'forgotten'` inside the staging row's
 *     payload_json.
 *   - On last entry resolved (all admitted+downgraded entries are
 *     `confirmed` or `forgotten`), flip the staging row's status to
 *     `'confirmed'` and stamp `reviewed_at`. The status always lands on
 *     `'confirmed'` (not `'forgotten'`) because the diff was reviewed
 *     completely — even if every entry was dropped. The plan's R20 text
 *     and the proposed-diff status enum (`pending | confirmed | forgotten`)
 *     leave `'forgotten'` for a future "ignore the whole diff" flow not
 *     wired in v0.2; keeping the binary `pending → confirmed` flip
 *     matches the simpler interpretation in U8's Approach text.
 *
 * Wrapped in `withStudent` from `~/db/client` so the diff lookup and
 * payload/status updates share one Postgres transaction.

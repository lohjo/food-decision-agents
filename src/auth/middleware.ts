// Auth middleware adapter — owns the single allowed read of the dev-bypass
// escape hatch (`DEV_BYPASS_AUTH`) and counselor bootstrap helpers.
//
// Why this file exists:
//   1. `DEV_BYPASS_AUTH=demo-a` lets the team run `pnpm dev` without WorkOS
//      env vars during Steps 5-10 of the migration. The env var is read in
//      exactly one place (this file) so a CI lint guard can fail the build
//      if a reference leaks elsewhere. Without that guard, the bypass could
//      drift into production code paths and silently grant access.
//   2. Real WorkOS users get a private empty student namespace. Demo seeded
//      rows are attached only for explicit demo/dev bypass sessions.
//
// Production never sets `DEV_BYPASS_AUTH`. The Vercel env-var list in
// `docs/plans/_archive/2026-05-12-002-feat-managed-agents-full-migration-plan.md` §10
// does not include it.

 * lint guard (`.github/workflows/lint-no-stale-flag.yml`-adjacent) treats

 *
 * Production never sets this var; if it somehow lands in a Vercel env, the
 * synthetic counselor still has to satisfy `counselor_students` to query
 * anything (an `auth-bypass:` counselor row would need to exist in prod
 * Postgres, which never happens by accident).
